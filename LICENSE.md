# Content License & Usage Policy

_Last updated: 2025-12-26_

This Policy governs the use of:

- All content in this GitHub repository;
- All related content shared in the official Discord server **“The PCs Secret”**; and
- Any other official documents, tweak packs, and materials released under the same ownership and clearly labeled as covered by this Policy.

It is intended to:

- Protect the Owner’s work;
- Allow strictly **non-commercial** community use and improvement; and
- Strongly restrict **commercial** and **AI-related** use; and
- Clarify that the Project and server exist primarily for **educational and research purposes** related to system behavior, performance, and configuration, and do **not** provide professional advice or guaranteed results.

> **Important:** This is a custom policy inspired by Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0, but it is **not** a standard Creative Commons license. For the Content covered here, **only this Policy applies**. In any conflict between this Policy and any external template, summary, label, badge, or license name, **this Policy prevails**.

This Policy is primarily a **conditional copyright license**: permission is granted only if you comply with these terms. If you do not agree or do not comply, you have **no permission** to copy, distribute, or create derivatives of the Content beyond what is allowed by mandatory law.

## 1. Definitions

For the purposes of this Policy:

- **Owner**:  
  The individual who owns and administers:
  - this GitHub repository; and  
  - the Discord server **“The PCs Secret”**,  
  and who is publicly identified by the handle **“Pppp1116”** on both GitHub and Discord.  
  References to the Owner include any future legal entity that may lawfully assume ownership of the Project.

- **Project**:  
  This repository and its associated content, including scripts, documentation, guides, issues, discussions, and any related materials.

- **Official Discord**:  
  The associated Discord server and its channels, messages, attachments, and files.  
  The current invite link (if any) is published in the repository README and/or in official Owner communications.

- **Content**:  
  Any text, code, configuration, registry keys, values, comments, documentation, images, files, or other material created or shared by the Owner or within the Project / Official Discord, whether past, present, or future, and in any format or medium (including archives, screenshots, exports, and forks), to the extent it is protected by copyright or related rights (including curated compilations).  
  **Boundary clarification:** Ideas, facts, functional methods, and general techniques are not owned by the Owner; however, the **specific expression**, and the **selection, arrangement, and compilation** of materials may be protected.

- **Owner Content**:  
  Content originally created, curated, or expressly published by the Owner.

- **Member Content**:  
  Content posted by other users (members) in the Official Discord or contributed to the repository (e.g., via issues, pull requests, discussions, or attachments).

- **You / User / Licensee**:  
  Any individual, group, organization, or legal entity that accesses, uses, copies, distributes, or otherwise interacts with the Content.

- **Non-Commercial Use**:  
  Use that complies fully with Section 2.2.

- **Minimal Quotation**:  
  Small quotations used for commentary, criticism, or review (Section 5), that do not function as a substitute for the original Content.

- **Substantial Use**:  
  Use that goes beyond Minimal Quotation, as described in Section 5.

- **Substantial Member Content**:  
  Member Content that is more than Minimal Quotation and is relied upon as practical guidance, structured information, or reusable material (for example: full guides, multi-step procedures, scripts/configs, structured tables, curated lists, test packs, or compilations).  
  For clarity, ordinary chat reactions, short opinions, or small snippets typically are not Substantial Member Content.

- **Written Permission**:  
  Permission that is explicit and in writing from the Owner, granted via:
  - Email from `usp9133@duck.com`, or
  - A Discord message from the Owner’s official Discord account, or
  - A GitHub statement clearly posted by the Owner in this repository (e.g., in an Issue/Discussion/Release/Commit message),  
  and that clearly describes what is permitted (what Content, where it will be used, how it will be used, whether it is monetized, and any time limits).

- **Interpretation of “including”**:  
  Where this Policy uses phrases such as “includes”, “including”, or “for example”, such lists are illustrative and **not exhaustive**. Similar behaviors or uses that have the same practical effect are covered even if not explicitly listed.

- **Capacity**:  
  By using the Content, you represent that you have the legal capacity to enter into binding agreements in your jurisdiction, or that you have obtained any necessary consent from a parent or legal guardian. If you are under the age of majority in your jurisdiction, you must obtain permission from a parent or legal guardian before using the Content, and that parent or guardian will be deemed the Licensee for purposes of this Policy.

- **Business User**:  
  A user acting for purposes relating to their trade, business, craft, profession, employment, or commercial activity.

- **Consumer**:  
  A user acting primarily for purposes outside their trade, business, craft, profession, or employment.

---

## 1A. License Grant and Reservation of Rights

1. Subject to your full and ongoing compliance with this Policy, the Owner grants you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, **non-sublicensable** license to access, copy, modify, and distribute the Content solely for **Non-Commercial Use** as defined in Section 2.  
   This license is a conditional permission: if you breach this Policy, the permission terminates automatically (Section 16).

2. No other rights are granted. In particular, you receive **no**:
   - Ownership or title in the Content;
   - Commercial rights of any kind;
   - Rights to sublicense, assign, or transfer this license to others (see Section 2.3).

3. To the maximum extent permitted by law, **all rights not expressly granted to you in this Policy are reserved by the Owner**.

---

## 1B. Acceptance, Assent, and How This Applies on GitHub and Discord

1. **Using the Content means you accept these terms.**  
   If you access, copy, use, distribute, or create derivatives of the Content beyond what is allowed by mandatory law, you agree to be bound by this Policy.

2. **GitHub (repository use).**  
   By cloning, forking, downloading, or otherwise using the repository contents, you agree that such use is governed by this Policy.

3. **GitHub (contributions).**  
   By submitting Member Content to this repository (Issues, Pull Requests, Discussions, attachments, or other contributions), you agree to Section 9, including the license grant in Section 9.2.

4. **Discord (server rules).**  
   The Owner may require acknowledgement of server rules/terms that link to this Policy. If you post Member Content in the Official Discord, you agree to Section 9, including the license grant in Section 9.2.

5. **If you do not agree.**  
   Do not use the Content beyond mandatory-law allowances, and do not submit contributions.

---

## 2. Non-Commercial Use and Exclusive Commercial Rights

### 2.1. Exclusive Commercial Rights (Owner)

All commercial rights in Owner Content are **exclusively reserved** by the Owner. This includes, without limitation:

- Selling access to the Content or derivative works;
- Bundling tweak packs, presets, configs, or guides into paid products;
- Providing “premium” or subscription access (Patreon, Discord roles, memberships, etc.) based on Owner Content;
- Using the Content as part of any paid service, consultancy, or course.

Unless you have explicit Written Permission from the Owner, **you receive no commercial rights at all**.

For the avoidance of doubt, the following are always considered **commercial uses** and are not permitted without explicit Written Permission from the Owner:

- Offering paid “PC optimization”, “tuning”, “coaching”, or “consultancy” services that substantially rely on the Content (whether or not the Content is directly shown to the client);
- Selling or advertising “FPS boost”, “competitive advantage”, or similar services based on tweaks or configurations derived from the Content;
- Operating any paid Discord server, Patreon, membership, or course where the main value proposition is access to tweaks, presets, or methodologies substantially derived from this Project.

### 2.2. Extended Definition of Non-Commercial Use

For this Policy, “Non-Commercial” means **you may not receive direct or indirect monetary compensation or other valuable consideration** in exchange for access to, or use of, the Content.

This includes, but is not limited to:

- Selling the Content or derivatives;
- Charging for access to tweak packs, scripts, or configuration bundles;
- Gating Content behind Patreon tiers, Ko-fi memberships, paid Discord roles, subscription websites, or similar models;
- “Support me and I’ll give you my tweak pack” schemes.

**Clarification (Business User use):**  
If you are a Business User and you use the Content in your work, services, employment, or any business activity (even if you do not directly charge for the Content), that use is treated as **commercial** under this Policy unless the Owner provides Written Permission.

#### 2.2.1. Monetized Educational Content is Commercial Under This Policy

Any publication that is monetized (including ads, sponsorships, affiliate links/commissions, paid placements, or similar) and that relies on the Content beyond Minimal Quotation is treated as **commercial use** under this Policy and therefore requires **Written Permission** from the Owner.

### 2.3. No Assignment or Sublicensing by Users

You may not assign, transfer, or sublicense any rights granted to you under this Policy to any other person or entity. Any attempt to do so without the Owner’s prior Written Permission is **void** and constitutes a breach of this Policy.

### 2.4. Mandatory Rights Under Law

Nothing in this Policy is intended to limit any rights that you cannot contractually waive or restrict under applicable law (such as mandatory exceptions or limitations under copyright law). However, to the maximum extent permitted by law, **all rights not expressly granted to you here are reserved by the Owner**.

---

## 3. Scope of Covered Content (GitHub + Discord + Mirrors)

This Policy applies to all related Content produced by or for the Project, including but not limited to:

- Files, scripts, docs, and data in this GitHub repository;
- Git commits, Issues, Pull Requests, Discussions, and Wiki pages;
- Messages, attachments, configuration files, guides, and tweak packs shared in the Official Discord **“The PCs Secret”**;
- Any official documents, preset packs, or tweak collections released under the Project name or branding on any platform.

If it comes from the Owner or is branded as part of this Project, **this Policy applies**, regardless of the platform.

---

## 3A. Private Channels, Early-Access Content, and Confidentiality

### 3A.1. Confidential / Early-Access Content

Some materials may be shared by the Owner in:

- Private or role-restricted channels in the Official Discord (for example, channels labelled or described as “early access”, “lab”, “testing”, “beta”, “internal”, or similar); or
- Direct messages (DMs) or small group chats initiated or explicitly approved by the Owner for testing or review.

Such materials are referred to as **Confidential / Early-Access Content**.

Unless the Owner expressly states otherwise in writing, your license to Confidential / Early-Access Content is limited to:

- Personal review and testing on your own systems; and
- Private discussion within the specific channels or groups where the Owner shared that Content.

You may **not**, without explicit Written Permission from the Owner:

- Repost, forward, or quote Confidential / Early-Access Content outside the specific channel(s) or DM(s) where it was originally shared (including other servers, social media, videos, or public repositories);
- Share screenshots, exports, or copies of such Content;
- Turn Confidential / Early-Access Content into public guides, packs, or videos, even if non-commercial.

If you lose access to the relevant private channel(s) or are removed/banned from the Official Discord, you must not continue to use or redistribute any Confidential / Early-Access Content and must delete all copies you possess, store, or control, including backups to the extent reasonably practicable, except to the extent you are required to retain them under applicable law.

### 3A.2. Competing Projects (No Large-Scale Copying)

Normal non-commercial discussion, testing, and small-scale referencing of the Content in other communities is allowed (subject to this Policy and proper attribution). What is not allowed is large-scale copying or structured replication of the Project’s Content such that it functions as a practical replacement for typical users.

This restriction targets copying of protected expression (files, guides, curated compilations). It is not intended to claim ownership of general ideas or facts.

---

## 3B. Access to the Official Discord and Project Resources

Access to the Official Discord **“The PCs Secret”**, including any roles, channels, or materials, is a privilege, not a right.

Subject to applicable law and platform rules, the Owner may, at their discretion and without obligation to provide a detailed explanation:

- Grant, restrict, or remove access to specific channels or roles;
- Remove or ban users from the Official Discord;
- Limit or revoke access to certain tools, files, or experimental content.

Nothing in this Policy shall be interpreted as creating any right or expectation of continued access to:

- The Official Discord or any of its channels;
- Confidential / Early-Access Content as defined in Section 3A; or
- Any future updates, tweaks, or discoveries.

If your access is removed or restricted, you must comply with all relevant provisions of this Policy, including any obligations related to Confidential / Early-Access Content and license termination.

---

## 4. Attribution Requirements

Whenever you use, share, redistribute, or build upon Owner Content or Substantial Member Content, you must clearly and visibly attribute the original source.

At a minimum, your attribution must include:

- The Owner’s public identifier: **“Pppp1116” (Discord & GitHub handle)**  
- A link to this repository (or the specific file/release you used);
- A link or reference to the Official Discord server **“The PCs Secret”** (using the current invite published by the Owner); and
- A clear statement that the original content or discovery belongs to the Owner (and/or named Member, where applicable), for example:  
  > “Original tweak/research by Pppp1116 (and contributors, see repo).”

Attribution must:

- Be visible wherever the Content is used or displayed (e.g., video description, blog article, README, script header, PDF intro);
- Not be hidden, minimized, or placed in an obscure location;
- Not be removed in forks, mirrors, or translations;
- Not be presented in a way that falsely suggests that you are the primary or sole author of the underlying discovery or tweak.

### 4.1. License Notice Propagation

If you redistribute Substantial Use of the Content (see Section 5), you must:

- Include a copy of this Policy in your distribution; **or**
- Provide a clear, working link to this Policy (for example, linking directly to this file in the repository).

You may not re-license the Content under a different license or present it as being under more permissive terms.

---

## 5. Substantial Use vs Minimal Quotation

Minimal Quotation for commentary, criticism, or review (e.g., a few lines in an article explaining a concept) may be acceptable if proper attribution is provided and the quotation does not function as a substitute for the original.

However, the following are considered **Substantial Use** and must fully comply with this Policy (non-commercial, attribution, no AI, etc.):

- Copying or republishing complete guides or large portions of them;
- Reproducing full `.reg`, `.bat`, `.ps1`, or similar files, or large sections;
- Republishing curated lists of registry keys, values, or settings **as compiled/presented by the Project**;
- Packaging multiple tweaks or discoveries from the Project into “packs”, “presets”, or “config bundles.”

Substantial Use also includes any compilation or re-expression that, even if reworded or reformatted, delivers substantially the same set of curated tweaks, configuration changes, or structured guidance as the Project in a way that a typical user could use as a functional substitute for the original Content.

When in doubt, treat your use as **Substantial Use**.

### 5.1. No Evasion or Technical Workarounds

You may not attempt to circumvent this Policy by:

- Splitting Content into smaller fragments across multiple sites, accounts, or repositories;
- Using images, screenshots, or video overlays in place of text solely to avoid license terms;
- Republishing slightly modified, reordered, or obfuscated Content that has the same practical effect as the original;
- Using intermediaries, bots, or automated accounts to reproduce the Content on your behalf.

Any such attempts will be treated as a breach of this Policy to the same extent as direct copying.

---

## 6. Derivative Works, Translations, and Reformatting

### 6.1. Derivative Works (Tweaks and Improvements)

You are allowed to **experiment**, **modify**, and **improve** registry keys, configurations, and tweaks **for non-commercial purposes**, and to share those improvements non-commercially, provided that:

1. You give full attribution as in Section 4;
2. You do not sell or gate the derivatives and do not otherwise monetize them;
3. You do not remove or hide markers, comments, or signatures from the original;
4. You clearly indicate where you have modified, combined, or extended the original Content (e.g., “based on tweaks by Pppp1116, modified by [your name]”), and you do not suggest or imply that the Owner has tested, approved, or endorsed your specific modifications or combinations.

Community experimentation and evolution of tweaks over time is welcome, as long as it remains non-commercial and properly credited.

Any public distribution of derivative works that incorporate Substantial Use of the Content must clearly state that they are subject to this Policy and may not be offered under more permissive terms.

### 6.2. Translations and Localizations (Allowed With Attribution)

Translating the Content into another language is considered a **derivative work**.

You may publicly distribute translations **non-commercially** provided that you:

- Preserve full attribution (Section 4);
- Clearly state that it is an **unofficial translation** of original work by the Owner (and/or Member);
- Do not misrepresent the translation as original research or as an “official” version.

This does not restrict small translated quotations for commentary, review, or discussion, provided you comply with Section 4.

### 6.3. Reformatting and Packaging

You may privately reformat Content (e.g., your own notes, local `.reg` files, local documentation) for personal use.

You may publicly redistribute substantial or structured copies **only** if the redistribution is non-commercial and fully complies with:

- Section 4 (Attribution + Policy notice),
- Section 10 (No AI use),
- Section 11 (No removal of markers/watermarks).

---

## 7. Third-Party Content, Links, and Tools

The Project and the Official Discord **“The PCs Secret”** may include:

- Links to third-party repositories, tools, scripts, guides, or websites;
- References to content owned and maintained by other authors;
- Embedded snippets that are clearly attributed to another creator or project.

Unless explicitly stated otherwise, such third-party content:

- **Is not owned by the Owner** and is **not** licensed under this Policy;
- Remains subject to its own license and terms set by the original author or project;
- Is only linked or referenced for convenience, testing, or discussion.

This Policy **does not grant you any rights** to use third-party content. You must:

- Check the original license of any external repository, tool, or guide;
- Comply with that third-party license and their usage rules;
- Not assume that a link or mention in **“The PCs Secret”** or this repository means you can reuse or redistribute that third-party content freely.

Any link or reference to third-party content:

- **does not imply endorsement, partnership, or responsibility** by the Owner; and
- does not transfer any intellectual property rights from the third party to you or to the Owner.

Nothing in this Policy shall be interpreted as granting you any license, right, or interest in third-party content by implication, estoppel, or otherwise. All such rights remain with their respective owners.

---

## 8. GitHub Forks, Clones, Issues, and Gists

By forking, cloning, or copying this repository (including Issues, Discussions, and Wiki content), **you agree that all such copies remain fully subject to this Policy**.

GitHub’s technical ability to fork, clone, or create gists **does not grant you any rights** beyond those explicitly allowed here. You may not:

- Use forks, mirrors, or gists to circumvent non-commercial restrictions;
- Strip attribution or watermarks in a fork or mirror;
- Re-license the Content under a different license.

If the Owner notifies you that a public fork, mirror, or gist is in breach of this Policy, you must promptly make it private or delete it, as reasonably requested by the Owner.

---

## 9. Member Content and License to the Owner

### 9.1. Member Ownership

Members retain ownership of their own original content (e.g., discoveries, test results, guides) posted in the Official Discord or contributed to the repository.

### 9.2. Member License to the Owner (Including Commercial Use)

By posting Member Content in the Official Discord **“The PCs Secret”** or contributing it to this repository (e.g., via issues, pull requests, discussions, or attachments), you grant the Owner a **worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable (to the maximum extent permitted by law), royalty-free, fully-paid, transferable and sublicensable license** to:

1. Use, copy, host, store, display, perform, reproduce, modify, adapt, translate, and create derivative works from the Member Content;
2. Combine the Member Content with Owner Content or other content in the Project;
3. Publish, distribute, and redistribute the Member Content (in original or modified form) as part of the Project or related projects; and
4. Use the Member Content **commercially** in any products, services, or materials of the Owner or the Owner’s licensees.

You also represent and warrant that:

- You have all necessary rights, licenses, and permissions to grant this license;
- Your Member Content does not knowingly infringe the rights of any third party; and
- Your Member Content is not subject to any confidentiality obligation that would conflict with this license.

Other users receive only the **non-commercial rights** described in this Policy. Member Content is **not** automatically free for others to monetize.

**Moral rights notice (where applicable):** Nothing in this Policy is intended to waive or limit any moral rights that cannot be waived under applicable law. Where moral rights apply, you agree not to assert them in a way that would prevent the Owner from exercising the license granted above to the maximum extent permitted by law.

### 9.3. Member Content Responsibility and Moderation

1. Each Member is solely responsible for their own Member Content. The Owner does not generally pre-screen Member Content and does not endorse, approve, or guarantee the accuracy, safety, or legality of any Member Content.
2. Member Content may include opinions, interpretations, or experimental findings that are not verified by the Owner. You rely on such content at your own risk and must independently evaluate any technical claims before applying them.
3. Subject to applicable law and platform rules, the Owner may, but is not obligated to, monitor, edit, or remove Member Content. The Owner may remove or restrict access to Member Content at any time, for any or no stated reason, including in response to complaints or potential legal issues.
4. If you believe that any content in the Project or the Official Discord infringes your rights, violates applicable law, or is otherwise problematic, you may notify the Owner using the contact details in Section 12. Where reasonably appropriate, the Owner will review the complaint and may remove or restrict access to the relevant content in their discretion. Nothing in this Policy obligates the Owner to maintain, restore, or archive any removed content.

---

## 10. AI Scraping, Training, Embeddings, and Automated Use

### 10.1. Ten-Year AI Usage Ban for Third Parties (All AI Uses)

For a period of **ten (10) years** from the date when any specific Content is first made publicly available as part of this Project or in the Official Discord, **no person or entity other than the Owner** may use that Content, in whole or in part, for **any AI-related purpose** without the Owner’s explicit prior Written Permission.

This prohibition includes, without limitation:

- Training, fine-tuning, or evaluating any machine learning or AI model;
- Building or augmenting datasets;
- Generating embeddings, vector representations, or feature extractions;
- Using the Content as a systematic source of prompts, context, or knowledge in AI systems (including retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), “AI knowledge bases”, chatbots, or similar systems), whether the AI system is public or private;
- Using automated agents or AI coding assistants in a way that ingests, summarizes, transforms, indexes, or reproduces **Substantial Use** of the Content as part of an AI workflow, where the result is a reusable dataset/knowledge base or is used to serve outputs to others; and
- Automated large-scale scraping or harvesting specifically intended to feed AI systems.

**Evidence of “first made publicly available”:**
- For GitHub: the earliest timestamp visible in the public git history (first public commit, tag, release, or publication to a public branch) for the relevant Content.
- For Discord: the message timestamp in a publicly accessible channel or other reliable records.

**For the avoidance of doubt**, for purposes of any applicable text-and-data-mining exception (including Article 4 of Directive (EU) 2019/790 and its national implementations), the Owner **expressly reserves and opts out of** any permission to use the Content for text-and-data-mining or AI-related purposes by third parties, except where the Owner has given explicit prior Written Permission.

### 10.1.1. Limited Carve-Out for Incidental Local Tooling (No Dataset / No Reuse / No Sharing)

This Policy is intended to prohibit **AI-related exploitation** of the Content (training, dataset creation, embeddings/RAG, automated harvesting). It is not intended to police purely incidental, local, non-exported processing that does **not** create a reusable dataset/knowledge base and does **not** share or publish Content-derived outputs.

Accordingly, the following is permitted for **personal, local use only**, provided you do not publish, share, or deploy the result to third parties and you do not create a reusable dataset/knowledge base from the Content:

- Local spellcheck/grammar tools, local search/indexing for navigation, or other incidental software features that do not extract the Content into a shareable dataset or AI knowledge base.

If you are unsure whether your workflow falls within this carve-out, treat it as prohibited and request Written Permission under Section 12.

### 10.2. Owner Exception

The Owner may freely use Owner Content and Member Content (under the license in Section 9.2) for any AI-related purpose, including training, fine-tuning, evaluation, and hosting models.

### 10.3. No “Non-Commercial AI” Exception

There is **no automatic exception** for “non-commercial AI” or “academic research.” All AI-related uses by third parties require explicit prior Written Permission from the Owner, except to the extent mandatory law prohibits restriction.

### 10.4. Automated Bulk Access

You may not use bots, scrapers, or automated tools to systematically download, mirror, or harvest large portions of the Content beyond what is necessary for normal human viewing and non-commercial use (for example, cloning the repository once for personal use is acceptable; mass-mirroring multiple times to multiple destinations is not), unless you have the Owner’s Written Permission.

**Robots.txt / machine-readable signals:**  
Where the Owner publishes robots.txt or other machine-readable TDM/AI reservation signals on a web origin they control, those signals express the Owner’s preferences and rights reservation; they do not guarantee that all third parties will comply. Enforcement remains governed by this Policy, copyright law, and platform remedies.

---

## 11. Watermarking, Fingerprinting, and Technical Tracing

To enforce this Policy and verify authorship, the Owner may embed visible or invisible markers, including but not limited to:

- Invisible characters or structured formatting;
- Signature comments, hashes, or unique IDs; and
- Metadata or characteristic phrasing patterns.

You may **not**:

- Remove, alter, obfuscate, or attempt to strip such markers;
- Use tools or methods specifically aimed at erasing, bypassing, or reverse-engineering these markers, signatures, or fingerprinting techniques; or
- Publish guides, tools, or instructions whose **primary purpose** is to remove or defeat the Owner’s watermarking or tracing mechanisms.

The Owner may also use technical means (e.g., unique download links, fingerprinting, similarity detection) to detect large-scale copying or unauthorized AI use. These measures are used solely for abuse detection and enforcement.

By using the Content, you acknowledge and agree that the Owner may analyze publicly available materials and repositories for similarities or matches to the Content for the sole purpose of detecting unauthorized use or enforcing this Policy.

### 11.1. Reverse Engineering of Owner Tools and Protections

Except to the limited extent that applicable law expressly permits reverse engineering for interoperability or similar mandatory purposes, you may not reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code, design, or underlying algorithms of any proprietary binaries, utilities, scripts delivered only in compiled form, or online services provided by the Owner, where such actions are taken for the purpose of:

- Circumventing technical protection, watermarking, or fingerprinting mechanisms;
- Removing or weakening license enforcement, access controls, or usage restrictions; or
- Creating or seeding competing products or services based substantially on the Owner’s proprietary implementations.

Nothing in this Section 11.1 is intended to restrict lawful reverse engineering of third-party software (for example, operating systems, drivers, or games) that is not distributed by the Owner, provided that you still comply with all other parts of this Policy and any applicable third-party terms or laws.

## 12. Requesting Exceptions or Commercial Licenses

If you want to:

- Use the Content commercially (including any monetized educational content relying on the Content);
- Include it in paid memberships, Patreon tiers, or subscription models;
- Publish large mirrors or major derivative guides in a way that is commercially monetized; or
- Use the Content in any AI-related way;

you must obtain **Written Permission** from the Owner **before** publishing or deploying.

To request permission, contact the Owner through:

- The Official Discord server **“The PCs Secret”** (use the current invite published by the Owner), or  
- Email: `usp9133@duck.com`.

Your request should include:

- Who you are and how to contact you;
- Which Content you want to use;
- Where and how it will be published;
- Whether and how it will be monetized; and
- Whether any AI tools are involved.

The Owner may grant or refuse permission at their discretion and may impose additional conditions. Any permission should be assumed **denied** unless you receive Written Permission.

### 12.1. Revocability of Exceptions

Any permission, exception, or license granted by the Owner under this Policy is:

- Limited to the scope explicitly described in writing;
- Non-transferable; and
- **Revocable** in cases of material breach, abuse, misrepresentation, or material changes to how the Content is used.

If a granted permission is revoked, you must promptly cease the covered use and comply with any reasonable takedown or modification request issued by the Owner.

---

## 13. No Endorsement or Implied Partnership

You may not state or imply that you are:

- Officially endorsed by the Owner;
- Officially partnered with the Project; or
- Providing “official” or “certified” tweaks, builds, or packs,

unless you have explicit Written Permission.

Using the Owner’s name, branding, or server name in a way that suggests endorsement (e.g., “official tweaks,” “certified by Pppp1116”, “The PCs Secret official pack”) is strictly prohibited.

---

## 13A. Trademarks, Names, and Branding

1. All names, logos, icons, server names, and other branding associated with the Project, including but not limited to **“The PCs Secret”** and the handle **“Pppp1116”**, may be protected as trademarks, trade names, or distinctive identifiers to the extent available under applicable law.
2. This Policy **does not** grant you any rights or licenses in such marks or branding.
3. You may not use the Owner’s or Project’s names, logos, or branding:
   - In a way that suggests sponsorship, endorsement, or official status;
   - As part of your own product name, server name, or domain; or
   - In any confusingly similar or misleading manner.
4. Any permitted references must be purely descriptive (e.g., “based on tweaks by Pppp1116”) and must comply with Sections 4 and 13.

---

## 14. System Risk and User Responsibility

Registry edits, system tweaks, and configuration changes can:

- Cause instability, crashes, or performance regressions;
- Lead to data loss or corruption;
- Trigger bans in online games or services; or
- Render a system unbootable if misused.

By using any Content from this Project or the Official Discord **“The PCs Secret”**, **you accept full responsibility** for all results on your hardware, software, data, and accounts.

The Owner and contributors provide all Content **“as is”** and **“as available”**, with **no warranties of any kind**, whether express, implied, or statutory, including but not limited to any warranties of accuracy, non-infringement, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose.

To the maximum extent permitted by law:

- The Owner and contributors shall **not be liable** for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, or punitive damages, or for any loss of profits, revenue, data, or goodwill, arising out of or in connection with the Content or this Policy, even if advised of the possibility of such damages; and
- For **Business Users**, the total aggregate liability of the Owner and contributors for any and all claims arising out of or relating to the Content or this Policy shall not exceed the greater of **(a) EUR 50** or **(b) the total amount you paid (if any) directly to the Owner for access to the Project**, in all cases and for all time.

**Consumer notice:** If you are a Consumer, nothing in this Policy limits your mandatory rights. Certain exclusions, indemnities, and liability limitations may not apply to you to the extent prohibited by law.

**Carve-outs:** Nothing in this Policy limits liability to the extent such limitation is prohibited by law, including liability for intentional misconduct, fraud, gross negligence, or death/personal injury.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages or warranties. In such cases, the above exclusions and limitations shall apply only to the extent permitted by the laws of your jurisdiction.

Any example results, benchmark figures, latency measurements, frame-time graphs, or similar metrics shown in the Project or in the Official Discord are provided purely for illustration and may not be achievable on your systems. Differences in hardware, firmware, drivers, operating system builds, background software, and user configuration can materially change outcomes. You acknowledge that:

- No specific performance gain, latency reduction, or stability level is guaranteed; and
- You will not represent to others that the Owner “guarantees” particular results on any given setup.

---

## 14A. Research and Reverse Engineering Context

Some tweaks and discoveries in this Project and in the Official Discord **“The PCs Secret”** are based on:

- Reverse engineering and analysis of third-party software such as operating system components, drivers, games, or related binaries; and
- Empirical testing of registry keys, configuration flags, and low-level behaviors.

For clarity:

1. **No Distribution of Third-Party Binaries**  
   The Project and the Official Discord do **not** host, provide, or distribute:
   - Third-party drivers, games, operating system images, or other proprietary binaries;  
   - Cracked, modified, or “no-DRM” versions of such software;  
   - Tools whose primary purpose is to bypass license checks, DRM, or anti-cheat systems.

   Any samples or software used for analysis must be lawfully obtained by each user from legitimate sources (e.g., official vendors, platforms, or licenses).

2. **Educational and Research Purposes Only**  
   Reverse engineering and analysis discussed within the Project and the Official Discord are intended **solely for educational and research purposes**, particularly:
   - Understanding how systems and drivers behave;  
   - Identifying performance characteristics, bottlenecks, and side effects; and  
   - Informing safe and reproducible configuration changes by end-users.

   Nothing in this Policy should be interpreted as encouraging or authorizing you to infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, to violate third-party terms of service, or to circumvent legal protections on software or services.

3. **No Guarantee of Compliance with Third-Party Terms**  
   While the Project aims to focus on performance-oriented, educational analysis, it is ultimately your responsibility to:
   - Review and comply with the licenses and terms of service of any third-party software you use; and  
   - Ensure that any reverse engineering or analysis you perform is lawful in your jurisdiction.

   If any tension arises between this Policy and applicable law or third-party terms, you must follow the law and those third-party terms. You may not attribute any resulting violations or consequences to the Owner or the Project.

4. **No Encouragement of Circumvention**  
   The fact that certain system behaviors, flags, or internal mechanisms are discussed for educational purposes does not mean the Owner encourages or authorizes you to:
   - Circumvent license checks, DRM, anti-cheat, or other technical protection measures; or
   - Breach contractual obligations or terms of service you have accepted with third parties.

   Any decision to perform such actions is solely yours, done entirely at your own risk, and in violation of this Policy. You must not attribute such conduct to the Owner or the Project.

---

## 15. No Illegal Use or ToS Violations

You may not use this Content to:

- Circumvent DRM, anti-cheat systems, or other technical protection measures;
- Violate the terms of service of operating systems, games, or online services; or
- Engage in any illegal activity under applicable law.

You must not use the Content to obtain or market unfair advantages in competitive contexts, including but not limited to:

- Tweaks or configurations designed or advertised primarily to bypass, weaken, or exploit anti-cheat, anti-tamper, or integrity systems; or
- Services that promise competitive advantages in online games, tournaments, or ranked ladders in ways that violate fair-play policies or community standards.

If you choose to use any Content in such ways, you do so entirely at your own risk, and you must not attribute such misuse to the Owner or the Project.

### 16.6. Injunctive and Equitable Relief

You agree that any unauthorized use of the Content or breach of this Policy may cause irreparable harm to the Owner for which monetary damages may be inadequate. The Owner shall be entitled to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in any competent court, without the need to post a bond or prove actual damages, in addition to any other remedies available at law or in equity, to the extent permitted by law.

---

## 17. Governing Law and Jurisdiction

This Policy is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of **Portugal**.

Any disputes arising out of or in connection with this Policy, the Project, or the Content shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in **Lisbon, Portugal**, **except** where mandatory consumer protection laws require otherwise (including any mandatory rights regarding jurisdiction and applicable law that cannot be waived).

  Section and subsection headings are for convenience only and shall not affect the interpretation of this Policy.

- **Entire Agreement**:  
  This Policy constitutes the entire understanding between you and the Owner with respect to the Content and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous statements, summaries, or communications on the same subject, whether written or oral.

- **Policy Precedence**:  
  In case of any conflict between this Policy and any brief summary, FAQ, social media post, chat message, or informal explanation (including the TL;DR section), **this Policy text prevails**.

- **Survival**:  
  Provisions that by their nature should survive termination shall survive, including but not limited to Sections 2.1–2.4, 4–7, 9–12, 14–18, 19, and any payment, deletion, or limitation-of-liability obligations.
