# Contributing

By contributing to this repository or to the Official Discord “The PCs Secret”, you agree to the **Content License & Usage Policy** in `LICENSE.md` (the “Policy”).

If you do not agree, do not submit contributions.

## 1) Where this applies

This applies to contributions made via:

- GitHub Pull Requests (PRs), Issues, Discussions, Wikis, and attachments
- Any content posted in the Official Discord “The PCs Secret” (messages, files, guides, attachments)

## 2) Your license grant to the Owner (Policy Section 9.2)

By submitting any content (including text, code, configs, files, measurements, guides, or attachments), you grant the Owner the rights described in **Section 9.2** of `LICENSE.md`, including the right for the Owner to use your contribution commercially as part of the Project.

You represent and warrant that:

- You own your contribution or have the rights needed to submit it;
- Your contribution does not knowingly infringe third-party rights; and
- Your contribution is not subject to confidentiality obligations that would conflict with the Policy.

## 3) No commercial / no AI by default

Your contribution, and any redistribution of substantial parts of this Project, remains subject to the Policy’s restrictions, including:

- **Non-commercial use only** for third parties (Policy Section 2)
- **No AI-related use by third parties** (Policy Section 10)
- **Attribution required** (Policy Section 4)

## 4) Confidential / early-access content

If you receive access to private/role-restricted channels, DMs, or early-access materials from the Owner, you must comply with Policy Section **3A**. Do not repost or leak confidential/early-access content without Written Permission.

## 5) Practical guidelines

- Keep changes minimal and clearly explained.
- Include reproducible steps and system context where relevant (OS build, driver version, hardware).
- Avoid including proprietary third-party binaries or anything that violates third-party ToS.
- If you’re unsure whether something is allowed, ask the Owner first (Policy Section 12).

## 6) How to submit

1. Fork the repo (if needed).
2. Create a branch.
3. Submit a PR with:
   - What changed
   - Why it changed
   - Any testing notes / risks
4. By opening the PR, you reaffirm acceptance of the Policy.

Thank you for contributing.
