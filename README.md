# Content License & Intellectual Property Policy

_Last updated: December 8, 2025_

This policy applies to contributors and readers internationally and is intended to govern the handling, licensing, and use of technical content and research shared in association with this project and its related Discord server.

---

## 1. Licensing of Original Content by the Server Owner

All original technical materials authored by the server owner — including, but not limited to, discoveries, registry-level tweaks, configuration documentation, guides, research findings, and software utilities — are licensed under the:

**Creative Commons Attribution–NonCommercial–ShareAlike 4.0 International License (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 International)** Full license: [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)

This license grants users permission to copy, share, and adapt the licensed material, under the following conditions:

- **Attribution** — Proper credit must be given to the original author.
- **NonCommercial** — The material may not be used for commercial purposes.
- **ShareAlike** — Any adapted material must be released under the same license.

---

## 2. Member-Submitted Technical Content

Technical contributions submitted by members — including research notes, configuration discoveries, or explanatory content — remain the intellectual property of the submitting author.

By posting such material within the associated Discord server or repository, the author grants the community and server owners a **non-exclusive, non-commercial, perpetual, royalty-free license** to:

- View, archive, and reference the material for educational or research purposes within the project.
- Repost or share the material externally, provided that proper credit is clearly given (e.g., Original Author's Name and/or a link to the original context).
- Permit server moderation to reproduce the content in designated channels (e.g., "Verified Findings") for documentation purposes.

**Commercial Use Clarification:**
- **Strictly Prohibited:** Direct commercial exploitation, sale of files/guides, inclusion behind paywalls, or monetized resale of member-submitted content without explicit permission.
- **Permitted:** Incidental revenue generation via ad-supported platforms (e.g., YouTube tutorials, ad-supported blogs) or voluntary donations, provided the content itself is free to access and properly attributed.

---

## 3. Attribution, Removal, and Modification Requests

Authors may request correction of attribution or removal of curated reposts from documentation channels. Moderation will review such requests, taking into account historical and archival relevance. Removal of original Discord messages is subject to platform policy.

---

## 4. Reverse Engineering & DMCA Compliance

This project focuses on **interoperability, performance optimization, and educational analysis**. To ensure compliance with international copyright laws (including the DMCA and EU Software Directive):

1.  **No Proprietary Binaries:** We strictly prohibit the upload, hosting, or distribution of modified proprietary binaries (e.g., patched `.sys`, `.dll`, or `.exe` files).
2.  **Patches and Offsets Only:** Contributors may share knowledge in the form of "clean room" findings: hex offsets, registry keys, configuration strings, or differential patch files (`.bps`, `.diff`) that contain **no proprietary code**.
3.  **Interoperability Defense:** All analysis of drivers or software is conducted solely for the purpose of achieving interoperability or fixing defects/performance issues that the original vendor has not addressed.
4.  **No DRM Circumvention:** We do not condone or permit content intended to bypass Digital Rights Management (DRM), anti-cheat protection, or license activation mechanisms.

---

## 5. Exclusions and Third-Party Material

The permissions and licenses described in this policy **do not apply** to:
- Decompiled or reconstructed source code that infringes on proprietary IP.
- Extracts from proprietary tools owned by third parties (e.g., NVIDIA, Microsoft, AMD).
- External links to repositories or media hosted by third parties.

Third-party content remains subject to its original license. Such materials are shared solely for purposes of fair use commentary and research.

---

## 6. Limitation of Liability & Disclaimer

ALL content, guides, research, and software provided within this community (whether by the Server Owner or Members) are provided **“as-is” without any warranty** of any kind.

By using this content, you agree that:
- **You represent the sole responsible party** for any changes made to your hardware or software.
- The Server Owner, Moderation Team, and original authors are **NOT liable** for any damage, including but not limited to: hardware failure, operating system instability, data loss, bans from third-party services, or voiding of warranties.
- You are responsible for ensuring that your use of these tweaks complies with the EULA/ToS of the software or hardware you are modifying.

**Use all findings at your own risk.**

---

## 7. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Server Owner, Moderation Team, and community contributors from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, or expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of or in any way connected with:
- Your access to or use of the content provided here;
- Your violation of this Policy;
- Your violation of any third-party right, including without limitation any intellectual property right, publicity, confidentiality, property, or privacy right.

---

## 8. Enforcement & Termination

The Server Owner reserves the right to enforce this policy **at their sole discretion**. Failure to adhere to these terms—specifically regarding commercial theft, distribution of illegal binaries, or failure to attribute—may result in:
- Immediate removal of access to the community (Ban) without prior warning.
- Public designation of the offending party.
- Reporting to relevant platforms (e.g., GitHub, Discord, Patreon) for copyright infringement.

We reserve the right to revoke access to any user at any time, for any reason, with or without notice.

---

## 9. Severability

If any provision of this Policy is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision will be struck and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.

---

## 10. Acceptance of Terms

By participating in the community and submitting technical content, members acknowledge and agree to the terms set forth in this document. This policy may be updated to reflect regulatory, operational, or community requirements.
