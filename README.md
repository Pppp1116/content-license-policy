## 1. Licensing of Original Content by the Server Owner

All original technical materials authored by the server owner — including, but not limited to, discoveries, registry-level tweaks, configuration documentation, guides, research findings, and software utilities — are licensed under the:

**Creative Commons Attribution–NonCommercial–ShareAlike 4.0 International License (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 International)** Full license: [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)

This license grants users permission to copy, share, and adapt the licensed material, under the following conditions:

- **Attribution** — Proper credit must be given to the original author.
- **NonCommercial** — The material may not be used for commercial purposes.
- **ShareAlike** — Any adapted material must be released under the same license.

---

## 2. Member-Submitted Technical Content

Technical contributions submitted by members — including research notes, configuration discoveries, or explanatory content — remain the intellectual property of the submitting author.

By posting such material within the associated Discord server or repository, the author grants the community and server owners a **non-exclusive, non-commercial, perpetual, royalty-free license** to:

- View, archive, and reference the material for educational or research purposes within the project.
- Repost or share the material externally, provided that proper credit is clearly given (e.g., Original Author's Name and/or a link to the original context).
- Permit server moderation to reproduce the content in designated channels (e.g., "Verified Findings") for documentation purposes.

**Commercial Use Clarification:**
- **Strictly Prohibited:** Direct commercial exploitation, sale of files/guides, inclusion behind paywalls, or monetized resale of member-submitted content without explicit permission.
- **Permitted:** Incidental revenue generation via ad-supported platforms (e.g., YouTube tutorials, ad-supported blogs) or voluntary donations, provided the content itself is free to access and properly attributed.

---

## 3. Attribution, Removal, and Modification Requests

Authors may request correction of attribution or removal of curated reposts from documentation channels. Moderation will review such requests, taking into account historical and archival relevance. Removal of original Discord messages is subject to platform policy.

---

## 4. Exclusions and Third-Party Material

The permissions and licenses described in this policy **do not apply** to:
- Decompiled or reconstructed code (assembly, pseudocode, etc.),
- Function dumps or binary offsets derived from proprietary software,
- Screenshots or extracts from proprietary tools,
- External links to repositories or media hosted by third parties.

Third-party content remains subject to its original license. Such materials are shared solely for purposes of interoperability analysis, commentary, educational review, or research.

## 5. Limitation of Liability & Disclaimer

ALL content, guides, research, and software provided within this community (whether by the Server Owner or Members) are provided **“as-is” without any warranty** of any kind.

By using this content, you agree that:
- **You represent the sole responsible party** for any changes made to your hardware or software.
- The Server Owner, Moderation Team, and original authors are **NOT liable** for any damage, including but not limited to: hardware failure, operating system instability, data loss, bans from third-party services, or voiding of warranties.

**Use all findings at your own risk.**

## 6. Enforcement

Failure to adhere to this policy—specifically regarding the theft of content for prohibited commercial use or failure to provide proper attribution—may result in:
- Immediate removal of access to the community (Ban).
- Public designation of the offending party to prevent further community harm.
- Reporting to relevant platforms (e.g., GitHub, Discord, Patreon) for copyright infringement.
