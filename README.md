## 2. Member-Submitted Content & Rights

Technical contributions submitted by members (e.g., chat messages, research notes, guides) remain the intellectual property of the author.

By submitting content, the author grants the Community and Server Owner a **perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free license** to:
1.  **Archive and Display:** Keep the content visible for historical context and documentation, even if the user leaves the community.
2.  **Compile:** Incorporate findings into official community guides or "Verified Findings" lists.
3.  **Redistribute:** Share the content externally for educational purposes with attribution.

**Commercial Restriction:**
Members and third parties are **strictly prohibited** from harvesting community content for commercial sale, paid courses, or paywalled access (e.g., Patreon-locked guides) without the explicit written consent of the original author.

## 3. Reverse Engineering & Driver Modification Policy

To ensure compliance with the DMCA (USA), EU Software Directive, and other international laws, the following rules apply to all **driver and software analysis**:

1.  **Interoperability & Optimization Only:** All reverse engineering is conducted solely for the purposes of **interoperability, bug fixing, and performance optimization** where the original vendor has failed to provide a solution.
2.  **"Clean Room" Distribution:**
    - **ALLOWED:** Sharing hex offsets, registry keys, differential patches (`.bps`, `.diff`), and configuration strings.
    - **BANNED:** Uploading or hosting proprietary binaries (e.g., modified `.sys`, `.dll`, or `.exe` files) owned by vendors (NVIDIA, AMD, Microsoft, etc.).
3.  **No DRM Circumvention:** We do not condone, host, or permit discussion regarding the bypass of Digital Rights Management (DRM), license checks, or anti-cheat software.
4.  **Educational Intent:** All findings are shared for educational research. Users are responsible for verifying that their use of these tweaks complies with the EULA of the target software.

## 4. Data Privacy & Log Files

In the pursuit of troubleshooting, members may share system logs (e.g., DXDiag, Event Viewer, benchmarks).
- **User Responsibility:** You are responsible for **sanitizing (removing)** personal data (Real Name, IP Address, Serial Numbers) from logs before uploading.
- **No Liability:** The Server Owner and Moderation Team are not responsible for any data leaks resulting from users voluntarily uploading un-sanitized logs or screenshots.
