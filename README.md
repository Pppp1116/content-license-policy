## 2. Non-Commercial Use and Exclusive Commercial Rights

### 2.1. Exclusive Commercial Rights (Owner)

All commercial rights in Owner Content are **exclusively reserved** by the Owner. This includes, without limitation:

- Selling access to the Content or derivative works;
- Bundling tweak packs, presets, configs, or guides into paid products;
- Providing “premium” or subscription access (Patreon, Discord roles, memberships, etc.) based on Owner Content;
- Using the Content as part of any paid service, consultancy, or course.

Unless you have explicit written permission from the Owner, **you receive no commercial rights at all**.

### 2.2. Extended Definition of Non-Commercial Use

For this Policy, “Non-Commercial” means **you may not receive direct or indirect monetary compensation** in exchange for access to, or use of, the Content.

This includes, but is not limited to:

- Selling the Content or derivatives;
- Charging for access to tweak packs, scripts, or configuration bundles;
- Gating Content behind:
  - Patreon tiers,
  - Ko-fi memberships,
  - Paid Discord roles,
  - Subscription websites, or similar models;
- “Support me and I’ll give you my tweak pack” schemes.

#### 2.2.1. Limited Allowance for Ad-Supported Educational Content

Ad-supported educational content (for example, a YouTube video or blog post) may qualify as non-commercial **only if all of the following conditions are met**:

1. The content is genuinely **transformative**:
   - It explains, tests, or analyzes the tweaks;  
   - It is not just a re-upload, mirror, or read-through of the material or scripts; and
2. **Proper attribution** is given as defined in Section 4; and
3. The channel, site, or creator does **not**:
   - Sell or bundle tweak packs based on this Project;  
   - Gate “preset bundles” or “full configs” derived from this work behind donations, memberships, or subscriptions.

The Owner reserves the right, at their **sole discretion**, to determine whether a specific use is commercial or non-commercial, especially in borderline cases involving ad revenue, affiliate links, sponsorships, or indirect monetization. If the Owner notifies you that your use is considered commercial, you must either cease that use or obtain a commercial license.

### 2.3. No Assignment or Sublicensing by Users

You may not assign, transfer, or sublicense any rights granted to you under this Policy to any other person or entity. Any attempt to do so without the Owner’s prior written consent is **void** and constitutes a breach of this Policy.

### 2.4. Mandatory Rights Under Law

Nothing in this Policy is intended to limit any rights that you cannot contractually waive or restrict under applicable law (such as mandatory exceptions or limitations under copyright law). However, to the maximum extent permitted by law, **all rights not expressly granted to you here are reserved by the Owner**.

---

## 3. Scope of Covered Content (GitHub + Discord + Mirrors)

This Policy applies to all related Content produced by or for the Project, including but not limited to:

- Files, scripts, docs, and data in this GitHub repository;
- Git commits, Issues, Pull Requests, Discussions, and Wiki pages;
- Messages, attachments, configuration files, guides, and tweak packs shared in the Official Discord **“The PCs Secret”**;
- Any official documents, preset packs, or tweak collections released under the Project name or branding on any platform.

If it comes from the Owner or is branded as part of this Project, **this Policy applies**, regardless of the platform.

---

## 4. Attribution Requirements

Whenever you use, share, or build upon Owner Content or Substantial Member Content, you must clearly and visibly attribute the original source.

At a minimum, your attribution must include:

- The Owner’s public identifier: **“Pppp1116” (Discord & GitHub handle)**  
- A link to this repository:  
  `https://github.com/Pppp1116/content-license-policy`  
- A link to the Official Discord server **“The PCs Secret”**:  
  `https://discord.gg/avxB63dY2T`  
- A clear statement that the original content or discovery belongs to the Owner (and/or named Member, where applicable), for example:  
  > “Original tweak/research by Pppp1116 (and contributors, see repo).”

Attribution must:

- Be visible wherever the Content is used or displayed (e.g., video description, blog article, README, script header, PDF intro);
- Not be hidden, minimized, or placed in an obscure location;
- Not be removed in forks, mirrors, or translations.

### 4.1. License Notice Propagation

If you redistribute Substantial Use of the Content (see Section 5), you must:

- Include a copy of this Policy in your distribution; **or**
- Provide a clear, working link to this Policy (for example, linking directly to this file in the repository).

You may not re-license the Content under a different license or present it as being under more permissive terms.

---

## 5. Substantial Use vs Minimal Quotation

Small quotations for commentary, criticism, or review (e.g., a few lines in an article explaining a concept) may be acceptable if proper attribution is provided.

However, the following are considered **Substantial Use** and must fully comply with this Policy (non-commercial, attribution, no AI, etc.):

- Copying or republishing complete guides or large portions of them;
- Reproducing full `.reg`, `.bat`, `.ps1`, or similar files, or large sections;
- Republishing curated lists of registry keys, values, or settings derived from the Project;
- Packaging multiple tweaks or discoveries from the Project into “packs”, “presets”, or “config bundles.”

When in doubt, treat your use as **Substantial Use**.

### 5.1. No Evasion or Technical Workarounds

You may not attempt to circumvent this Policy by:

- Splitting Content into smaller fragments across multiple sites, accounts, or repositories;
- Using images, screenshots, or video overlays in place of text solely to avoid license terms;
- Republishing slightly modified, reordered, or obfuscated Content that has the same practical effect as the original;
- Using intermediaries, bots, or automated accounts to reproduce the Content on your behalf.

Any such attempts will be treated as a breach of this Policy to the same extent as direct copying.

---

## 6. Derivative Works, Translations, and Reformatting

### 6.1. Derivative Works (Tweaks and Improvements)

You are allowed to **experiment**, **modify**, and **improve** registry keys, configurations, and tweaks **for non-commercial purposes**, and to share those improvements non-commercially, provided that:

1. You give full attribution as in Section 4;
2. You do not sell or gate the derivatives;
3. You do not remove or hide markers, comments, or signatures from the original.

Community experimentation and evolution of tweaks over time is welcome, as long as it remains non-commercial and properly credited.

### 6.2. Translations and Localizations

Translating the Content into another language is considered a **derivative work**.

Any public distribution of translations (e.g., blogs, PDFs, GitHub repos, Discord posts in other servers) must:

- Preserve full attribution (Section 4);
- Clearly state that it is a **translation** of original work by the Owner (and/or Member);
- Not misrepresent the translation as original research.

For **large or standalone translations** (full guide PDF, full website mirror, multi-post series, etc.), **prior written approval from the Owner is required**.

### 6.3. Reformatting and Packaging

You may privately reformat Content (e.g., your own notes, local `.reg` files, local documentation) for personal use.

Any **public** redistribution of substantial or structured copies (e.g., downloadable script collections, preset bundles, server-ready `.reg/.bat` collections, packaged tweak sets) requires:

- Prior written consent from the Owner;  
- Full compliance with attribution and non-commercial rules.

---

## 7. Third-Party Content, Links, and Tools

The Project and the Official Discord **“The PCs Secret”** may include:

- Links to third-party GitHub repositories, tools, scripts, guides, or websites;
- References to content owned and maintained by other authors;
- Embedded snippets that are clearly attributed to another creator or project.

Unless explicitly stated otherwise, such third-party content:

- **Is not owned by the Owner** and is **not** licensed under this Policy;
- Remains subject to its own license and terms set by the original author or project;
- Is only linked or referenced for convenience, testing, or discussion.

This Policy **does not grant you any rights** to use third-party content. You must:

- Check the original license of any external repository, tool, or guide;
- Comply with that third-party license and their usage rules;
- Not assume that a link or mention in **“The PCs Secret”** or this repository means you can reuse or redistribute that third-party content freely.

Any link or reference to third-party content:

- **Does not imply endorsement, partnership, or responsibility** by the Owner;
- Does not transfer any intellectual property rights from the third party to you or to the Owner.

Nothing in this Policy shall be interpreted as granting you any license, right, or interest in third-party content by implication, estoppel, or otherwise. All such rights remain with their respective owners.

---

## 8. GitHub Forks, Clones, Issues, and Gists

By forking, cloning, or copying this repository (including Issues, Discussions, and Wiki content), **you agree that all such copies remain fully subject to this Policy**.

GitHub’s technical ability to fork, clone, or create gists **does not grant you any rights** beyond those explicitly allowed here. You may not:

- Use forks, mirrors, or gists to circumvent non-commercial restrictions;
- Strip attribution or watermarks in a fork or mirror;
- Re-license the Content under a different license.

---

## 9. Member Content and License to the Owner

### 9.1. Member Ownership

Members retain ownership of their own original content (e.g., discoveries, test results, guides) posted in the Official Discord or contributed to the repository.

### 9.2. Member License to the Owner

By posting Member Content in the Official Discord **“The PCs Secret”** or contributing it to this repository, you grant the Owner a **perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive license** to:

- Use, modify, compile, and integrate the Member Content into the Project;
- Publish and redistribute it as part of the Project or related projects;
- Use it **commercially** as part of Owner products, services, or materials.

Other users receive only the **non-commercial rights** described in this Policy. Member Content is **not** automatically free for others to monetize.

---

## 10. AI Scraping, Training, Embeddings, and Automated Use

### 10.1. Ten-Year AI Usage Ban for Third Parties

For a period of **ten (10) years** from the date of publication of any Content in this Project or in the Official Discord, **no person or entity other than the Owner** may use that Content for any AI-related purpose without explicit written permission from the Owner.

Prohibited AI uses include, but are not limited to:

- Training, fine-tuning, or evaluating machine learning models (LLMs, diffusion models, recommendation systems, etc.);
- Building or augmenting datasets;
- Generating embeddings, vector representations, or feature extractions;
- Automated summarization or large-scale extraction of patterns for model consumption;
- Using the Content as prompt source, context, or knowledge base in tools that expose it to third parties at scale.

### 10.2. Owner Exception

The Owner may freely use Owner Content and Member Content (under the license in Section 9.2) for any AI-related purpose, including training, fine-tuning, evaluation, and hosting models.

### 10.3. No “Non-Commercial AI” Exception

There is **no automatic exception** for “non-commercial AI” or “academic research.” All AI-related uses by third parties require explicit written permission from the Owner.

---

## 11. Watermarking, Fingerprinting, and Technical Tracing

To enforce this Policy and verify authorship, the Owner may embed visible or invisible markers, including but not limited to:

- Invisible characters or structured formatting;
- Signature comments, hashes, or unique IDs;
- Metadata or characteristic phrasing patterns.

You may **not**:

- Remove, alter, obfuscate, or attempt to strip such markers;
- Use tools or methods specifically aimed at erasing, bypassing, or reverse-engineering these markers, signatures, or fingerprinting techniques;
- Publish guides, tools, or instructions whose **primary purpose** is to remove or defeat the Owner’s watermarking or tracing mechanisms.

The Owner may also use technical means (e.g., unique download links, fingerprinting, similarity detection) to detect large-scale copying or unauthorized AI use. These measures are used solely for abuse detection and enforcement.

---

## 12. Requesting Exceptions or Commercial Licenses

If you want to:

- Use the Content commercially;
- Include it in paid memberships, Patreon tiers, or subscription models;
- Publish large translations, full mirrors, or major derivative guides;
- Use the Content in any AI-related way;

you must obtain **written permission** from the Owner **before** publishing or deploying.

To request permission, contact the Owner through:

- The Official Discord server **“The PCs Secret”**: `https://discord.gg/avxB63dY2T`, or

- Limited to the scope explicitly described in writing;
- Non-transferable; and
- **Revocable at will** by the Owner, especially in cases of abuse, misrepresentation, or material changes to how the Content is used.

If a granted permission is revoked, you must promptly cease the covered use and comply with any reasonable takedown or modification request issued by the Owner.

---

## 13. No Endorsement or Implied Partnership

You may not state or imply that you are:

- Officially endorsed by the Owner;
- Officially partnered with the Project; or
- Providing “official” or “certified” tweaks, builds, or packs,

unless you have explicit written permission.

Using the Owner’s name, branding, or server name in a way that suggests endorsement (e.g., “official tweaks,” “certified by Pppp1116”, “The PCs Secret official pack”) is strictly prohibited.

---

## 14. System Risk and User Responsibility

Registry edits, system tweaks, and configuration changes can:

- Cause instability, crashes, or performance regressions;
- Lead to data loss or corruption;
- Trigger bans in online games or services;
- Render a system unbootable if misused.

By using any Content from this Project or the Official Discord **“The PCs Secret”**, **you accept full responsibility** for all results on your hardware, software, data, and accounts.

The Owner and contributors provide all Content **“as is”**, with **no warranties of any kind**, and are **not liable** for any direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damage.

---

## 15. No Illegal Use or ToS Violations

You may not use this Content to:

- Circumvent DRM, anti-cheat systems, or other technical protection measures;
- Violate the terms of service of operating systems, games, or online services;
- Engage in any illegal activity under applicable law.

If you choose to use any Content in such ways, you do so entirely at your own risk, and you must not attribute such misuse to the Owner or the Project.

---

## 16. Enforcement, Termination, and Remedies

### 16.1. License Termination on Breach

Any **material breach** of this Policy or the applicable license automatically and immediately **terminates all rights** previously granted to you to use, adapt, or redistribute the Content.

Upon written request from the Owner, you must promptly:

- Cease any further use, distribution, or publication of the Content or its derivatives.

### 16.2. Bans and Access Restrictions

The Owner may, at their discretion:

- Ban users from the Official Discord **“The PCs Secret”**;

- Revoke any previously granted special permissions or exceptions.

### 16.3. Financial Consequences and Legal Action

In addition to termination and takedown, the Owner reserves the right to seek:

- Statutory or actual damages where applicable;
- Recovery of enforcement costs, including reasonable legal fees, to the extent permitted by law.

---

## 17. Governing Law and Jurisdiction

This Policy is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of **Portugal**.

Any disputes arising out of or in connection with this Policy, the Project, or the Content shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in **Lisbon, Portugal**, without regard to conflict of law principles.

---

## 18. Changes to This Policy

The Owner may update or modify this Policy from time to time. Significant changes may be announced in this repository and/or in the Official Discord **“The PCs Secret”**.

- New Content published after an update is subject to the updated Policy.
- Previously distributed Content remains governed by the Policy that was in effect at the time of its distribution, unless otherwise stated.

---

## 19. No Waiver, Severability, and Policy Precedence

- **No Waiver**:  
  Failure by the Owner to enforce any provision of this Policy in a particular instance does **not** constitute a waiver of the right to enforce that provision or any other provision in the future.

- **Severability**:  
  If any part of this Policy is found invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect and shall be interpreted so as to give maximum effect to the Owner’s original intent.

- **Headings**:  
  Section and subsection headings are for convenience only and shall not affect the interpretation of this Policy.

- **Entire Agreement**:  
  This Policy constitutes the entire understanding between you and the Owner with respect to the Content and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous statements, summaries, or communications on the same subject, whether written or oral.

- **Policy Precedence**:  
  In case of any conflict between this Policy and any brief summary, FAQ, social media post, chat message, or informal explanation (including the TL;DR section), **this Policy text prevails**.

---

## 20. Not Legal Advice

This Policy expresses the Owner’s intentions and conditions for use of the Content. It is not formal legal advice. If you need legal certainty for a specific use case, consult a qualified lawyer in your jurisdiction.
