# Content License & Intellectual Property Policy
_Last updated: 08/12/2025_

This policy applies to contributors and readers internationally and is intended
to govern the handling, licensing, and use of technical content and research
shared in association with this project and its related Discord server.

## 1. Licensing of Original Content by the Server Owner

All original technical materials authored by the server owner — including, but
not limited to, discoveries, registry-level tweaks, configuration documentation,
guides, research findings, and software utilities — are licensed under the:

**Creative Commons Attribution–NonCommercial–ShareAlike 4.0 International License (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 International)**  
Full license: https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/

This license grants users permission to copy, share, and adapt the licensed
material, under the following conditions:

- **Attribution** — Proper credit must be given.
- **NonCommercial** — The material may not be used for commercial purposes.
- **ShareAlike** — Any adapted material must be released under the same license.

This license does not imply endorsement or association by the server owner, nor
does it provide any warranty or guarantee regarding the correctness, stability,
or impact of applying the documented configurations or procedures.

## 2. Member-Submitted Technical Content

Technical contributions submitted by members — including research notes,
configuration discoveries, or explanatory content — remain the intellectual
property of the submitting author.

By posting such material within the associated Discord server, the author grants
a **non-exclusive, non-commercial, revocable, royalty-free license** for users
to:

- View, reference, and utilize the material for educational or research purposes,
- Repost or share the material externally, provided that proper credit is clearly
  given (e.g., Discord username),
- Permit server moderation to reproduce or reference the content in designated
  channels (including "Verified Findings") for documentation and organizational
  purposes.

**Commercial redistribution, sale, inclusion behind paywalls, or monetized
resale of member-submitted content is strictly prohibited** without the explicit,
prior, written permission of the author.

---

## 3. Attribution, Removal, and Modification Requests

Authors may request correction of attribution or removal of curated reposts
from documentation channels. Moderation will review such requests, taking into
account historical and archival relevance. Removal of original Discord messages
is subject to platform policy and moderation discretion.

---

## 4. Exclusions and Third-Party Material

The permissions and licenses described in this policy **do not apply** to the
following materials:

- Decompiled or reconstructed code (assembly, pseudocode, or similar),
- Function dumps,
- Binary offsets derived from proprietary software,
- Screenshots or extracts from proprietary tools,
- External links to repositories, videos, articles, or other hosted media,
- Non-technical content such as humor, music, or casual conversation.

Third-party content remains subject to its original license and the more
restrictive license shall always prevail. Such materials are shared solely for
purposes of interoperability analysis, commentary, educational review, or
research.

---

## 5. Limitation of Liability

All content, guides, and findings are provided **“as-is” without any warranty**.
The authors and server moderation are **not liable for hardware damage,
operating system instability, software malfunction, or data loss** resulting from
the application of techniques, configurations, or research documented within this
project or server.

## 6. Acceptance of Terms and Policy Changes

By participating in the community and submitting technical content, members
acknowledge and agree to the terms set forth in this document. This policy may
be updated to reflect regulatory, operational, or community requirements.

If you have questions, require clarification, or seek an exception, please
contact the server moderation team.
