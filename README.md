# Content License & Usage Policy

_Last updated: 2025-12-08_

This document governs the use of:

- All content in this GitHub repository;
- All related content shared in the official Discord server **“The PCs Secret”**;
- Any other official documents, tweak packs, and materials released under the same ownership.

It is intended to:

- Protect the Owner’s work;
- Allow strictly **non-commercial** community use and improvement; and
- Strongly restrict **commercial** and **AI-related** use;
- Clarify that the Project and server exist primarily for **educational and research purposes** related to system behavior, performance, and configuration, and do **not** provide professional advice or guaranteed results.

> **Important:** This is a custom policy inspired by Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0, but it is **not** a standard Creative Commons license. For the Content covered here, **only this Policy applies**. In any conflict between this Policy and any external template, summary, or license label, **this Policy prevails**.

By accessing, using, copying, or distributing any Content, **you agree to be bound** by this Policy. If you do not agree, do not access, use, copy, or distribute the Content.

- **Capacity**:  
  By using the Content, you represent that you have the legal capacity to enter into binding agreements in your jurisdiction, or that you have obtained any necessary consent from a parent or legal guardian. If you are under the age of majority in your jurisdiction, you must obtain permission from a parent or legal guardian before using the Content, and that parent or guardian will be deemed the Licensee for purposes of this Policy.

---

## 1A. License Grant and Reservation of Rights

1. Subject to your full and ongoing compliance with this Policy, the Owner grants you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, **non-sublicensable** license to access and use the Content solely for **Non-Commercial Use** as defined in Section 2.
2. No other rights are granted. In particular, you receive **no**:
   - Ownership or title in the Content;
   - Commercial rights of any kind;
   - Rights to sublicense, assign, or transfer this license to others (see Section 2.3).
3. To the maximum extent permitted by law, **all rights not expressly granted to you in this Policy are reserved by the Owner**.

---

## 2. Non-Commercial Use and Exclusive Commercial Rights

### 2.1. Exclusive Commercial Rights (Owner)

All commercial rights in Owner Content are **exclusively reserved** by the Owner. This includes, without limitation:

- Selling access to the Content or derivative works;
- Bundling tweak packs, presets, configs, or guides into paid products;
- Providing “premium” or subscription access (Patreon, Discord roles, memberships, etc.) based on Owner Content;
- Using the Content as part of any paid service, consultancy, or course.

Unless you have explicit written permission from the Owner, **you receive no commercial rights at all**.

For the avoidance of doubt, the following are always considered **commercial uses** and are not permitted without explicit written permission from the Owner:

- Offering paid “PC optimization”, “tuning”, “coaching”, or “consultancy” services that substantially rely on the Content (whether or not the Content is directly shown to the client);
- Selling or advertising “FPS boost”, “competitive advantage”, or similar services based on tweaks or configurations derived from the Content;
- Operating any paid Discord server, Patreon, membership, or course where the main value proposition is access to tweaks, presets, or methodologies substantially derived from this Project.

### 2.2. Extended Definition of Non-Commercial Use

For this Policy, “Non-Commercial” means **you may not receive direct or indirect monetary compensation** in exchange for access to, or use of, the Content, including any form of money, cryptocurrency, credits, gifts, sponsorships, affiliate commissions, or other valuable consideration, whether paid by end-users, sponsors, or platforms.

This includes, but is not limited to:

- Selling the Content or derivatives;
- Charging for access to tweak packs, scripts, or configuration bundles;
- Gating Content behind:
  - Patreon tiers,
  - Ko-fi memberships,
  - Paid Discord roles,
  - Subscription websites, or similar models;
- “Support me and I’ll give you my tweak pack” schemes.

#### 2.2.1. Limited Allowance for Ad-Supported Educational Content

Ad-supported educational content (for example, a YouTube video or blog post) may qualify as non-commercial **only if all of the following conditions are met**:

1. The content is genuinely **transformative**:
   - It explains, tests, or analyzes the tweaks;  
   - It is not just a re-upload, mirror, or read-through of the material or scripts; and
2. **Proper attribution** is given as defined in Section 4; and
3. The channel, site, or creator does **not**:
   - Sell or bundle tweak packs based on this Project;  
   - Gate “preset bundles” or “full configs” derived from this work behind donations, memberships, or subscriptions.
4. The primary value of the educational content must come from your **own commentary, analysis, or testing**, not from simply reproducing the Owner’s Content or tweak packs in bulk.

The Owner reserves the right, at their **reasonable discretion**, to determine whether a specific use is commercial or non-commercial, especially in borderline cases involving ad revenue, affiliate links, sponsorships, or indirect monetization. If the Owner notifies you that your use is considered commercial, you must either cease that use or obtain a commercial license.

### 2.3. No Assignment or Sublicensing by Users

You may not assign, transfer, or sublicense any rights granted to you under this Policy to any other person or entity. Any attempt to do so without the Owner’s prior written consent is **void** and constitutes a breach of this Policy.

### 2.4. Mandatory Rights Under Law

Nothing in this Policy is intended to limit any rights that you cannot contractually waive or restrict under applicable law (such as mandatory exceptions or limitations under copyright law). However, to the maximum extent permitted by law, **all rights not expressly granted to you here are reserved by the Owner**.

---

## 3. Scope of Covered Content (GitHub + Discord + Mirrors)

This Policy applies to all related Content produced by or for the Project, including but not limited to:

- Files, scripts, docs, and data in this GitHub repository;
- Git commits, Issues, Pull Requests, Discussions, and Wiki pages;
- Messages, attachments, configuration files, guides, and tweak packs shared in the Official Discord **“The PCs Secret”**;
- Any official documents, preset packs, or tweak collections released under the Project name or branding on any platform.

If it comes from the Owner or is branded as part of this Project, **this Policy applies**, regardless of the platform.

---

## 3A. Private Channels, Early-Access Content, and Competing Projects

### 3A.1. Private and Early-Access Content

In addition to the general definition of Content in Section 1, some materials may be shared by the Owner in:

- Private or role-restricted channels in the Official Discord (for example, channels labelled or described as “early access”, “lab”, “testing”, “beta”, “internal”, or similar); or
- Direct messages (DMs) or small group chats initiated or explicitly approved by the Owner for testing or review.

Such materials are referred to in this Policy as **Private / Early-Access Content**.

Unless the Owner expressly states otherwise in writing, your license to Private / Early-Access Content is limited to:

- Personal review and testing on your own systems; and
- Private discussion within the specific channels or groups where the Owner shared that Content.

You may **not**, without explicit written permission from the Owner:

- Repost, forward, or quote Private / Early-Access Content outside the specific channel(s) or DM(s) where it was originally shared (including other servers, social media, videos, or public repositories);
- Share screenshots, exports, or copies of such Content;
- Turn Private / Early-Access Content into public guides, packs, or videos, even if non-commercial.

If you lose access to the relevant private channel(s) or are removed/banned from the Official Discord, you must not continue to use or redistribute any Private / Early-Access Content and should delete any copies you control, except to the extent you are required to retain them under applicable law.

### 3A.2. Use of Content to Seed Competing Projects

You may not systematically use the Content, including Private / Early-Access Content, to build, seed, or populate:

- A competing Discord server or community whose primary purpose is to provide a substantially similar set of tweaks, presets, or methodologies; or
- A competing project, website, or repository that substantially replicates the structure, scope, or key discoveries of this Project, such that it functions as a practical replacement for typical users.

Normal non-commercial discussion, testing, and small-scale referencing of the Content in other communities is allowed (subject to this Policy and proper attribution). What is not allowed is large-scale copying or structured migration of knowledge with the intent of replicating or replacing this Project.

---

## 3B. Access to the Official Discord and Project Resources

Access to the Official Discord **“The PCs Secret”**, including any roles, channels, or materials, is a privilege, not a right.

Subject to applicable law and platform rules, the Owner may, at their discretion and without obligation to provide a detailed explanation:

- Grant, restrict, or remove access to specific channels or roles;
- Remove or ban users from the Official Discord;
- Limit or revoke access to certain tools, files, or experimental content.

Nothing in this Policy shall be interpreted as creating any right or expectation of continued access to:

- The Official Discord or any of its channels;
- Private / Early-Access Content as defined in Section 3A; or
- Any future updates, tweaks, or discoveries.

If your access is removed or restricted, you must comply with all relevant provisions of this Policy, including any obligations related to Private / Early-Access Content and license termination.

---

## 4. Attribution Requirements

Whenever you use, share, or build upon Owner Content or Substantial Member Content, you must clearly and visibly attribute the original source.

At a minimum, your attribution must include:

- The Owner’s public identifier: **“Pppp1116” (Discord & GitHub handle)**  
- A link to this repository:  
  `https://github.com/Pppp1116/content-license-policy`  
- A link to the Official Discord server **“The PCs Secret”**:  
  `https://discord.gg/avxB63dY2T`  
- A clear statement that the original content or discovery belongs to the Owner (and/or named Member, where applicable), for example:  
  > “Original tweak/research by Pppp1116 (and contributors, see repo).”

Attribution must:

- Be visible wherever the Content is used or displayed (e.g., video description, blog article, README, script header, PDF intro);
- Not be hidden, minimized, or placed in an obscure location;
- Not be removed in forks, mirrors, or translations;
- Not be presented in a way that falsely suggests that you are the primary or sole author of the underlying discovery or tweak.

### 4.1. License Notice Propagation

If you redistribute Substantial Use of the Content (see Section 5), you must:

- Include a copy of this Policy in your distribution; **or**
- Provide a clear, working link to this Policy (for example, linking directly to this file in the repository).

You may not re-license the Content under a different license or present it as being under more permissive terms.

---

## 5. Substantial Use vs Minimal Quotation

Small quotations for commentary, criticism, or review (e.g., a few lines in an article explaining a concept) may be acceptable if proper attribution is provided.

However, the following are considered **Substantial Use** and must fully comply with this Policy (non-commercial, attribution, no AI, etc.):

- Copying or republishing complete guides or large portions of them;
- Reproducing full `.reg`, `.bat`, `.ps1`, or similar files, or large sections;
- Republishing curated lists of registry keys, values, or settings derived from the Project;
- Packaging multiple tweaks or discoveries from the Project into “packs”, “presets”, or “config bundles.”

Substantial Use also includes any compilation or re-expression that, even if reworded or reformatted, delivers substantially the same set of tweaks, registry keys, or configuration changes as the Project in a way that a typical user could use as a functional substitute for the original Content.

When in doubt, treat your use as **Substantial Use**.

### 5.1. No Evasion or Technical Workarounds

You may not attempt to circumvent this Policy by:

- Splitting Content into smaller fragments across multiple sites, accounts, or repositories;
- Using images, screenshots, or video overlays in place of text solely to avoid license terms;
- Republishing slightly modified, reordered, or obfuscated Content that has the same practical effect as the original;
- Using intermediaries, bots, or automated accounts to reproduce the Content on your behalf.

Any such attempts will be treated as a breach of this Policy to the same extent as direct copying.

---

## 6. Derivative Works, Translations, and Reformatting

### 6.1. Derivative Works (Tweaks and Improvements)

You are allowed to **experiment**, **modify**, and **improve** registry keys, configurations, and tweaks **for non-commercial purposes**, and to share those improvements non-commercially, provided that:

1. You give full attribution as in Section 4;
2. You do not sell or gate the derivatives;
3. You do not remove or hide markers, comments, or signatures from the original;
4. You clearly indicate where you have modified, combined, or extended the original Content, for example by stating “based on tweaks by Pppp1116, modified by [your name]”, and you do not suggest or imply that the Owner has tested, approved, or endorsed your specific modifications or combinations.

Community experimentation and evolution of tweaks over time is welcome, as long as it remains non-commercial and properly credited.

Any public distribution of derivative works that incorporate Substantial Use of the Content must clearly state that they are subject to this Policy and may not be offered under more permissive terms.

### 6.2. Translations and Localizations

Translating the Content into another language is considered a **derivative work**.

Any public distribution of translations (e.g., blogs, PDFs, GitHub repos, Discord posts in other servers) must:

- Preserve full attribution (Section 4);
- Clearly state that it is a **translation** of original work by the Owner (and/or Member);
- Not misrepresent the translation as original research.

For **large or standalone translations** (full guide PDF, full website mirror, multi-post series, etc.), **prior written approval from the Owner is required**.

This does not restrict small translated quotations for commentary, review, or discussion, provided you comply with Section 4 and do not present the translation as an official or complete version.

### 6.3. Reformatting and Packaging

You may privately reformat Content (e.g., your own notes, local `.reg` files, local documentation) for personal use.

Any **public** redistribution of substantial or structured copies (e.g., downloadable script collections, preset bundles, server-ready `.reg/.bat` collections, packaged tweak sets) requires:

- Prior written consent from the Owner;  
- Full compliance with attribution and non-commercial rules.

---

## 7. Third-Party Content, Links, and Tools

The Project and the Official Discord **“The PCs Secret”** may include:

- Links to third-party GitHub repositories, tools, scripts, guides, or websites;
- References to content owned and maintained by other authors;
- Embedded snippets that are clearly attributed to another creator or project.

Unless explicitly stated otherwise, such third-party content:

- **Is not owned by the Owner** and is **not** licensed under this Policy;
- Remains subject to its own license and terms set by the original author or project;
- Is only linked or referenced for convenience, testing, or discussion.

This Policy **does not grant you any rights** to use third-party content. You must:

- Check the original license of any external repository, tool, or guide;
- Comply with that third-party license and their usage rules;
- Not assume that a link or mention in **“The PCs Secret”** or this repository means you can reuse or redistribute that third-party content freely.

Any link or reference to third-party content:

- **Does not imply endorsement, partnership, or responsibility** by the Owner;
- Does not transfer any intellectual property rights from the third party to you or to the Owner.

Nothing in this Policy shall be interpreted as granting you any license, right, or interest in third-party content by implication, estoppel, or otherwise. All such rights remain with their respective owners.

---

## 8. GitHub Forks, Clones, Issues, and Gists

By forking, cloning, or copying this repository (including Issues, Discussions, and Wiki content), **you agree that all such copies remain fully subject to this Policy**.

GitHub’s technical ability to fork, clone, or create gists **does not grant you any rights** beyond those explicitly allowed here. You may not:

- Use forks, mirrors, or gists to circumvent non-commercial restrictions;
- Strip attribution or watermarks in a fork or mirror;
- Re-license the Content under a different license.

If the Owner notifies you that a public fork, mirror, or gist is in breach of this Policy, you must promptly make it private or delete it, as reasonably requested by the Owner.

---

## 9. Member Content and License to the Owner

### 9.1. Member Ownership

Members retain ownership of their own original content (e.g., discoveries, test results, guides) posted in the Official Discord or contributed to the repository.

### 9.2. Member License to the Owner

By posting Member Content in the Official Discord **“The PCs Secret”** or contributing it to this repository, you grant the Owner a **worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable (to the maximum extent permitted by law), royalty-free, fully-paid, transferable and sublicensable license** to:

1. Use, copy, host, store, display, perform, reproduce, modify, adapt, translate, and create derivative works from the Member Content;
2. Combine the Member Content with Owner Content or other content in the Project;
3. Publish, distribute, and redistribute the Member Content (in original or modified form) as part of the Project or related projects;
4. Use the Member Content **commercially** in any products, services, or materials of the Owner or the Owner’s licensees.

You also represent and warrant that:

- You have all necessary rights, licenses, and permissions to grant this license;
- Your Member Content does not knowingly infringe the rights of any third party;
- Your Member Content is not subject to any confidentiality obligation that would conflict with this license.

Other users receive only the **non-commercial rights** described in this Policy. Member Content is **not** automatically free for others to monetize.

**Moral rights notice (where applicable):** Nothing in this Policy is intended to waive or limit any moral rights that cannot be waived under applicable law. Where moral rights apply, you agree not to assert them in a way that would prevent the Owner from exercising the license granted above to the maximum extent permitted by law.

### 9.3. Member Content Responsibility and Moderation

1. Each Member is solely responsible for their own Member Content. The Owner does not generally pre-screen Member Content and does not endorse, approve, or guarantee the accuracy, safety, or legality of any Member Content.
2. Member Content may include opinions, interpretations, or experimental findings that are not verified by the Owner. You rely on such content at your own risk and must independently evaluate any technical claims before applying them.
3. Subject to applicable law and platform rules, the Owner may, but is not obligated to, monitor, edit, or remove Member Content. The Owner may remove or restrict access to Member Content at any time, for any or no stated reason, including in response to complaints or potential legal issues.
4. If you believe that any content in the Project or the Official Discord infringes your rights, violates applicable law, or is otherwise problematic, you may notify the Owner using the contact details in Section 12. Where reasonably appropriate, the Owner will review the complaint and may remove or restrict access to the relevant content in their discretion. Nothing in this Policy obligates the Owner to maintain, restore, or archive any removed content.

---

## 10. AI Scraping, Training, Embeddings, and Automated Use

### 10.1. Ten-Year AI Usage Ban for Third Parties

For a period of **ten (10) years** from the date when any specific Content is first made publicly available as part of this Project or in the Official Discord, **no person or entity other than the Owner** may use that Content, in whole or in part, for any AI-related purpose without the Owner’s explicit prior written permission.

This prohibition includes, without limitation:

- Training, fine-tuning, or evaluating any machine learning or AI model;
- Building or augmenting datasets;
- Generating embeddings, vector representations, or feature extractions;
- Automated large-scale scraping or harvesting specifically intended to feed AI systems;
- Using the Content as a systematic source of prompts, context, or knowledge in tools that expose it to third parties at scale.

**For the avoidance of doubt**, for purposes of any applicable text-and-data-mining exception (including Article 4 of Directive (EU) 2019/790 and its national implementations), the Owner **expressly reserves and opts out of** any permission to use the Content for text-and-data-mining or AI-related purposes by third parties, except where the Owner has given explicit written permission.

### 10.2. Owner Exception

The Owner may freely use Owner Content and Member Content (under the license in Section 9.2) for any AI-related purpose, including training, fine-tuning, evaluation, and hosting models.

### 10.3. No “Non-Commercial AI” Exception

There is **no automatic exception** for “non-commercial AI” or “academic research.” All AI-related uses by third parties require explicit written permission from the Owner.

### 10.4. Automated Bulk Access

You may not use bots, scrapers, or automated tools to systematically download, mirror, or harvest large portions of the Content beyond what is necessary for normal human viewing and non-commercial use (for example, cloning the repository once for personal use is acceptable; mass-mirroring multiple times to multiple destinations is not), unless you have the Owner’s written permission.

---

## 11. Watermarking, Fingerprinting, and Technical Tracing

To enforce this Policy and verify authorship, the Owner may embed visible or invisible markers, including but not limited to:

- Invisible characters or structured formatting;
- Signature comments, hashes, or unique IDs;
- Metadata or characteristic phrasing patterns.

You may **not**:

- Remove, alter, obfuscate, or attempt to strip such markers;
- Use tools or methods specifically aimed at erasing, bypassing, or reverse-engineering these markers, signatures, or fingerprinting techniques;
- Publish guides, tools, or instructions whose **primary purpose** is to remove or defeat the Owner’s watermarking or tracing mechanisms.

The Owner may also use technical means (e.g., unique download links, fingerprinting, similarity detection) to detect large-scale copying or unauthorized AI use. These measures are used solely for abuse detection and enforcement.

By using the Content, you acknowledge and agree that the Owner may analyze public materials and repositories for similarities or matches to the Content for the sole purpose of detecting unauthorized use or enforcing this Policy.

### 11.1. Reverse Engineering of Owner Tools and Protections

Except to the limited extent that applicable law expressly permits reverse engineering for interoperability or similar mandatory purposes, you may not:

- Reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code, design, or underlying algorithms of any proprietary binaries, utilities, scripts delivered only in compiled form, or online services provided by the Owner, where such actions are taken for the purpose of:
  - Circumventing technical protection, watermarking, or fingerprinting mechanisms;
  - Removing or weakening license enforcement, access controls, or usage restrictions;
  - Creating or seeding competing products or services based substantially on the Owner’s proprietary implementations.

Nothing in this Section 11.1 is intended to restrict or chill lawful reverse engineering of third-party software (for example, operating systems, drivers, or games) that is not distributed by the Owner, provided that you still comply with all other parts of this Policy and any applicable third-party terms or laws.

---

## 12. Requesting Exceptions or Commercial Licenses

If you want to:

- Use the Content commercially;
- Include it in paid memberships, Patreon tiers, or subscription models;
- Publish large translations, full mirrors, or major derivative guides;
- Use the Content in any AI-related way;

you must obtain **written permission** from the Owner **before** publishing or deploying.

To request permission, contact the Owner through:

- The Official Discord server **“The PCs Secret”**: `https://discord.gg/avxB63dY2T`, or  
- Email: `usp9133@duck.com`.

Your request should include:

- Who you are and how to contact you;
- Which Content you want to use;
- Where and how it will be published;
- Whether and how it will be monetized.

The Owner may grant or refuse permission at their discretion and may impose additional conditions.

### 12.1. Revocability of Exceptions

Any permission, exception, or license granted by the Owner under this Policy is:

- Limited to the scope explicitly described in writing;
- Non-transferable; and
- **Revocable** in cases of material breach, abuse, misrepresentation, or material changes to how the Content is used.

If a granted permission is revoked, you must promptly cease the covered use and comply with any reasonable takedown or modification request issued by the Owner.

---

## 13. No Endorsement or Implied Partnership

You may not state or imply that you are:

- Officially endorsed by the Owner;
- Officially partnered with the Project; or
- Providing “official” or “certified” tweaks, builds, or packs,

unless you have explicit written permission.

Using the Owner’s name, branding, or server name in a way that suggests endorsement (e.g., “official tweaks,” “certified by Pppp1116”, “The PCs Secret official pack”) is strictly prohibited.

---

## 13A. Trademarks, Names, and Branding

1. All names, logos, icons, server names, and other branding associated with the Project, including but not limited to **“The PCs Secret”** and the handle **“Pppp1116”**, may be protected as trademarks, trade names, or distinctive identifiers.
2. This Policy **does not** grant you any rights or licenses in such marks or branding.
3. You may not use the Owner’s or Project’s names, logos, or branding:
   - In a way that suggests sponsorship, endorsement, or official status;
   - As part of your own product name, server name, or domain;
   - In any confusingly similar or misleading manner.
4. Any permitted references must be purely descriptive (e.g., “based on tweaks by Pppp1116”) and must comply with Sections 4 and 13.

---

## 14. System Risk and User Responsibility

Registry edits, system tweaks, and configuration changes can:

- Cause instability, crashes, or performance regressions;
- Lead to data loss or corruption;
- Trigger bans in online games or services;
- Render a system unbootable if misused.

By using any Content from this Project or the Official Discord **“The PCs Secret”**, **you accept full responsibility** for all results on your hardware, software, data, and accounts.

The Owner and contributors provide all Content **“as is”** and **“as available”**, with **no warranties of any kind**, whether express, implied, or statutory, including but not limited to any warranties of accuracy, non-infringement, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose.

To the maximum extent permitted by law:

- The Owner and contributors shall **not be liable** for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, exemplary, or punitive damages, or for any loss of profits, revenue, data, or goodwill, arising out of or in connection with the Content or this Policy, even if advised of the possibility of such damages; and
- The total aggregate liability of the Owner and contributors for any and all claims arising out of or relating to the Content or this Policy shall not exceed the greater of **(a) EUR 50** or **(b) the total amount you paid (if any) directly to the Owner for access to the Project**, in all cases and for all time.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages or warranties. In such cases, the above exclusions and limitations shall apply only to the extent permitted by the laws of your jurisdiction.

Any example results, benchmark figures, latency measurements, frame-time graphs, or similar metrics shown in the Project or in the Official Discord are provided purely for illustration and may not be achievable on your systems. Differences in hardware, firmware, drivers, operating system builds, background software, and user configuration can materially change outcomes. You acknowledge that:

- No specific performance gain, latency reduction, or stability level is guaranteed; and
- You will not represent to others that the Owner “guarantees” particular results on any given setup.

## 14A. Research and Reverse Engineering Context

Some tweaks and discoveries in this Project and in the Official Discord **“The PCs Secret”** are based on:

- Reverse engineering and analysis of third-party software such as operating system components, drivers, games, or related binaries; and
- Empirical testing of registry keys, configuration flags, and low-level behaviors.

For clarity:

1. **No Distribution of Third-Party Binaries**  
   The Project and the Official Discord do **not** host, provide, or distribute:
   - Third-party drivers, games, operating system images, or other proprietary binaries;  
   - Cracked, modified, or “no-DRM” versions of such software;  
   - Tools whose primary purpose is to bypass license checks, DRM, or anti-cheat systems.

   Any samples or software used for analysis must be lawfully obtained by each user from legitimate sources (e.g., official vendors, platforms, or licenses).

2. **Educational and Research Purposes Only**  
   Reverse engineering and analysis discussed within the Project and the Official Discord are intended **solely for educational and research purposes**, particularly:
   - Understanding how systems and drivers behave;  
   - Identifying performance characteristics, bottlenecks, and side effects;  
   - Informing safe and reproducible configuration changes by end-users.

   Nothing in this Policy should be interpreted as encouraging or authorizing you to infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, to violate third-party terms of service, or to circumvent legal protections on software or services.

3. **No Guarantee of Compliance with Third-Party Terms**  
   While the Project aims to focus on performance-oriented, educational analysis, it is ultimately your responsibility to:
   - Review and comply with the licenses and terms of service of any third-party software you use; and  
   - Ensure that any reverse engineering or analysis you perform is lawful in your jurisdiction.

   If any tension arises between this Policy and applicable law or third-party terms, you must follow the law and those third-party terms. You may not attribute any resulting violations or consequences to the Owner or the Project.

4. **No Encouragement of Circumvention**  
   The fact that certain system behaviors, flags, or internal mechanisms are discussed for educational purposes does not mean the Owner encourages or authorizes you to:
   - Circumvent license checks, DRM, anti-cheat, or other technical protection measures; or
   - Breach contractual obligations or terms of service you have accepted with third parties.

   Any decision to perform such actions is solely yours, done entirely at your own risk, and in violation of this Policy. You must not attribute such conduct to the Owner or the Project.

## 15. No Illegal Use or ToS Violations

You may not use this Content to:

- Circumvent DRM, anti-cheat systems, or other technical protection measures;
- Violate the terms of service of operating systems, games, or online services;
- Engage in any illegal activity under applicable law.

You must not use the Content to obtain or market unfair advantages in competitive contexts, including but not limited to:

- Tweaks or configurations designed or advertised primarily to bypass, weaken, or exploit anti-cheat, anti-tamper, or integrity systems; or
- Services that promise competitive advantages in online games, tournaments, or ranked ladders in ways that violate fair-play policies or community standards.

If you choose to use any Content in such ways, you do so entirely at your own risk, and you must not attribute such misuse to the Owner or the Project.
