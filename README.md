## Executive Summary (TL;DR)
- **Original Content by Owner**: Licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 – share and adapt non-commercially with attribution; derivatives must use the same license.
- **Member Content**: Owned by you; grants community perpetual rights for archiving, adaptation, compilation, and educational sharing. No commercial use without your consent.
- **AI Use**: Prohibited for commercial training or scraping; allowed for non-commercial research under CC terms.
- **Feedback**: Voluntary ideas grant us rights to use without compensation.
- **Reverse Engineering**: For education, interoperability, and fixes only. Share clean info (e.g., patches); no binaries or DRM bypass.
- **Privacy & Risks**: Sanitize your shared data; use all content at your own risk – no warranties or liability for damages.
- **Enforcement**: Zero tolerance for violations; bans at discretion.
- **Disputes**: Informal resolution first; governed by [Insert Your Country] law.
- **Acceptance**: By participating, you agree. Check for updates regularly.

If you disagree, discontinue use immediately.

## 1. Licensing of Original Content by the Server Owner

All original technical materials authored by the **Server Owner** – including discoveries, registry tweaks, documentation, guides, and utilities – are licensed under the **Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)**.  
[View License Deed](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) | [View Full Legal Code](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/legalcode.en).

**Permissions**:
- **Share**: Copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format.
- **Adapt**: Remix, transform, and build upon the material (e.g., translating a guide or integrating it into a tutorial).

**Conditions**:
- **Attribution**: Provide appropriate credit, such as including the Server Owner's username (Pppp1116), a link to this repository (https://github.com/Pppp1116/content-license-policy), and the original publication date. Do this in a reasonable manner without implying endorsement.
- **NonCommercial**: Do not use for commercial purposes, including sales, paywalled content (e.g., Patreon exclusives), or sponsored promotions (where primary intent is monetary gain).
- **ShareAlike**: If you remix, transform, or build upon the material, distribute your contributions under the same CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license.

*Note: The Server Owner reserves the right to re-license their own original works under different terms at any time. This does not affect previously distributed copies, which remain under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.*

**AI-Assisted Content**: If AI tools are used, the content is original only if substantially modified by the Owner. Raw AI outputs must credit the tool (e.g., "Generated with assistance from Grok").

**Forks and Derivatives**: Forks of this repository must retain this policy file and clearly attribute any changes to the original (e.g., via Git commit messages or a CHANGES.md file).

## 2. Member-Submitted Content & Rights

Technical contributions submitted by members (e.g., chat messages, research notes, guides, code snippets) remain the intellectual property of the original author.

By submitting content, you grant the Community and Server Owner a **perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license** to:
1. **Archive and Display**: Retain and display the content for historical context and documentation, even if you leave the community (e.g., in searchable archives).
2. **Adapt and Update**: Modify, translate, correct, or update the content (e.g., fixing errors or updating for new software versions) without further permission, while preserving original attribution.
3. **Compile**: Incorporate your findings into official community guides or "Verified Findings" lists, with attribution (e.g., listing contributors alphabetically with links to original posts if available).
4. **Redistribute**: Share the content externally for non-commercial educational purposes, always with proper attribution.

**Commercial Restriction**: Members and third parties may not harvest or use community content for commercial sale, paid courses, paywalled access (e.g., Patreon-locked guides), or sponsored content without the explicit written consent of the original author. Non-commercial uses include free blog posts or YouTube videos; contact authors for exceptions.

**Consent and Revocation**: Include "#licensed" in your submission to affirm explicit consent. Authors may request removal of non-archival content (e.g., for personal reasons), subject to Owner approval. Archived copies may be anonymized but not deleted.

**Collaborative Content**: For joint contributions (e.g., group-edited guides), all authors must consent to external sharing. In disputes, the Server Owner decides.

**IP Infringement Reporting**: If you believe your content is misused, report via [contact email/DM] with evidence; investigations will occur within 7 business days.

## 3. AI Scraping and Training Policy

The content of this project is protected under the NonCommercial (NC) condition of the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license.

1. **Commercial AI Training Prohibited**: Using content from this repository for **commercial machine learning model training, data scraping, or data mining** is considered commercial use and is **strictly prohibited** without a separate, negotiated licensing agreement from the Server Owner.
2. **Non-Commercial Research**: Use for academic, non-profit, or personal research purposes is permitted under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0, with attribution.
3. **Detection and Enforcement**: We may employ watermarks or monitoring to detect unauthorized AI use. Violations may lead to legal action.

## 4. Feedback and Suggestions

If you provide feedback, ideas, or suggestions regarding the project, server organization, or technical discoveries ("Feedback"), you acknowledge that such Feedback is non-confidential. You grant the Server Owner an unrestricted, perpetual, royalty-free, worldwide right to use, implement, modify, and incorporate your Feedback for any purpose, without compensation or credit obligation to you.

**Examples**: Suggesting a new tweak or community feature grants us rights to develop it.

## 5. Reverse Engineering & Driver Modification Policy

To ensure compliance with the **DMCA (USA, 17 U.S.C. § 1201)**, **EU Software Directive (2009/24/EC, Article 6)**, and other international laws, the following rules apply to all driver and software analysis:

1. **Interoperability & Optimization Only**: Reverse engineering is solely for **interoperability**, compatibility, error correction, bug fixing, or performance optimization where the vendor has not provided solutions.
2. **"Clean Room" Distribution**:
   - **ALLOWED**: Sharing hex offsets, registry keys, differential patches (`.bps`, `.diff`), configuration strings, pseudocode, or derived algorithms.
   - **BANNED**: Uploading or hosting proprietary binaries (e.g., modified `.sys`, `.dll`, or `.exe` files) from vendors (NVIDIA, AMD, Microsoft, etc.).
3. **No DRM Circumvention**: We do not condone, host, or permit discussions on bypassing Digital Rights Management (DRM), license checks, or anti-cheat software (e.g., limited to reporting bugs to vendors).
4. **Educational Intent**: Findings are for educational research. Users must verify compliance with target software EULAs.
5. **Safety Requirements**: Shared tweaks must include warnings (e.g., "This may cause instability") and reversal instructions (e.g., "To undo: delete this key").
6. **Open-Source Alternatives**: Encouraged where possible (e.g., linking to OSS drivers).

## 6. Data Privacy & Log Files

In troubleshooting, members may share system logs (e.g., DXDiag, Event Viewer, benchmarks).

- **User Responsibility**: You must **sanitize** (remove) personal data like real names, IP addresses, serial numbers, or emails before uploading. Use tools like redaction software if needed.
- **No Liability**: The Server Owner and Moderation Team are not responsible for data leaks from unsanitized uploads.
- **GDPR/Privacy Compliance**: If you're in the EU or similar, ensure your shares comply with data protection laws. We do not collect personal data intentionally.

## 7. Exclusions (What is NOT Licensed)

The licenses above **do not apply** to:
- **Confidential Information**: Leaked closed-beta drivers, NDAs, or trade secrets.
- **Proprietary Assets**: Screenshots of private codebases or decompiled output infringing copyrights.
- **Third-Party Links**: External repositories, hosted media, or linked content.
- **Malicious Content**: Anything intended to harm systems (e.g., malware disguised as tweaks).

## 8. Limitation of Liability (The "As-Is" Clause)

**READ CAREFULLY**: ALL content, scripts, registry files, and advice are provided **“as-is” without warranty of any kind**, express or implied, including fitness for a particular purpose.

By applying any tweak or configuration, you acknowledge:
1. **Full Risk Assumption**: For your hardware, software, and data.
2. **No Liability For**:
   - Hardware damage (e.g., from overclocking/undervolting).
   - OS corruption or boot loops.
   - Data loss or breaches.
   - Bans/suspensions from services (e.g., anti-cheat).
   - Warranty voiding.

**Do not apply modifications if you do not accept these risks.**

## 9. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Server Owner, Moderation Team, and Contributors from any claims, damages, legal fees, or liabilities arising from:
- Your policy violations.
- Misuse of provided information.
- Infringement of third-party rights (e.g., EULA breaches).

This includes defending us at your expense.

## 10. Enforcement & Termination

The Server Owner enforces this policy at their **sole discretion**.
- **Zero Tolerance**: For malware, illegal content, stolen assets, or repeated violations – immediate ban.
- **Ban Authority**: Community access is a privilege. We may remove users anytime, for any reason, without notice or appeal.
- **Appeals Process**: Limited to email requests; decisions are final.

## 11. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution

Disputes related to this Policy or community are governed by the laws of **[Insert Your Country/State Here]**, without conflict of laws rules.

- **Informal Resolution**: Attempt good-faith contact with the Server Owner before legal action (e.g., via email, allowing 30 days response).
- **Jurisdiction**: Exclusive in [Insert Courts Here].
- **No Class Actions**: Disputes on an individual basis only.

## 12. Severability & Survival

- **Severability**: If any provision is unenforceable, the rest remain in effect. We'll replace invalid parts with similar enforceable ones.
- **Survival**: Sections on licenses (2), liability (8), indemnification (9), and governing law (11) survive termination of access.

## 13. Acceptance

By joining the server, viewing this repository, or submitting content, you signify acceptance of this policy. If you do not agree, discontinue use immediately.

We recommend reviewing periodically for updates.

## International Considerations

This policy complies with major frameworks (e.g., US DMCA, EU GDPR, CC licenses) but users must ensure local law compliance. Translations available upon request; English version prevails.
