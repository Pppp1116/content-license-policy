## 2. Non-Commercial Use and Exclusive Commercial Rights

### 2.1. Exclusive Commercial Rights (Owner)

All commercial rights in Owner Content are **exclusively reserved** by the Owner. This includes, without limitation:

- Selling access to the content or derivative works;
- Bundling tweak packs, presets, configs, or guides into paid products;
- Providing “premium” or subscription access (Patreon, Discord roles, memberships, etc.) based on Owner Content;
- Using the content as part of any paid service, consultancy, or course.

Unless you have explicit written permission from the Owner, **you receive no commercial rights at all**.

### 2.2. Extended Definition of Non-Commercial Use

For this Policy, “Non-Commercial” means **you may not receive direct or indirect monetary compensation** in exchange for access to, or use of, the content.

This includes, but is not limited to:

- Selling the content or derivatives;
- Charging for access to tweak packs, scripts, or configuration bundles;
- Gating content behind:
  - Patreon tiers,
  - Ko-fi memberships,
  - Paid Discord roles,
  - Subscription websites, or similar models;
- “Support me and I’ll give you my tweak pack” schemes.

#### 2.2.1. Limited Allowance for Ad-Supported Educational Content

Ad-supported educational content (for example, a YouTube video or blog post) may qualify as non-commercial **only if all of the following conditions are met**:

1. The content is genuinely **transformative**:
   - It explains, tests, or analyzes the tweaks;  
   - It is not just a re-upload, mirror, or read-through of the material or scripts; and
2. **Proper attribution** is given as defined in Section 4; and
3. The channel, site, or creator does **not**:
   - Sell or bundle tweak packs based on this Project;  
   - Gate “preset bundles” or “full configs” derived from this work behind donations, memberships, or subscriptions.

If you are unsure whether your use is non-commercial, assume that it is **not allowed** and request permission (see Section 12).

---

## 3. Scope of Covered Content (GitHub + Discord + Mirrors)

This Policy applies to all related content produced by or for the Project, including but not limited to:

- Files, scripts, docs, and data in this GitHub repository;
- Git commits, Issues, Pull Requests, Discussions, and Wiki pages;
- Messages, attachments, configuration files, guides, and tweak packs shared in the Official Discord **“The PCs Secret”**;
- Any official documents, preset packs, or tweak collections released under the Project name or branding on any platform.

If it comes from the Owner or is branded as part of this Project, **this Policy applies**, regardless of the platform.

---

## 4. Attribution Requirements

Whenever you use, share, or build upon Owner Content or substantial Member Content, you must clearly and visibly attribute the original source.

At a minimum, your attribution must include:

- The Owner’s public identifier: **“Pppp1116” (Discord & GitHub handle)**  
- A link to this repository:  
  `https://github.com/Pppp1116/content-license-policy`  
- A link to the Official Discord server **“The PCs Secret”**:  
  `https://discord.gg/avxB63dY2T`  
- A clear statement that the original content or discovery belongs to the Owner (and/or named Member, where applicable), for example:  
  > “Original tweak/research by Pppp1116 (and contributors, see repo).”

Attribution must:

- Be visible wherever the content is used or displayed (e.g., video description, blog article, README, script header, PDF intro);
- Not be hidden, minimized, or placed in an obscure location;
- Not be removed in forks, mirrors, or translations.

### 4.1. License Notice Propagation

If you redistribute Substantial Use of the Content (see Section 5), you must:

- Include a copy of this Policy in your distribution; **or**
- Provide a clear, working link to this Policy (for example, linking directly to this file in the repository).

You may not re-license the Content under a different license or present it as being under more permissive terms.

---

## 5. Substantial Use vs Minimal Quotation

Small quotations for commentary, criticism, or review (e.g., a few lines in an article explaining a concept) may be acceptable if proper attribution is provided.

However, the following are considered **Substantial Use** and must fully comply with this Policy (non-commercial, attribution, no AI, etc.):

- Copying or republishing complete guides or large portions of them;
- Reproducing full `.reg`, `.bat`, `.ps1`, or similar files, or large sections;
- Republishing curated lists of registry keys, values, or settings derived from the Project;
- Packaging multiple tweaks or discoveries from the Project into “packs”, “presets”, or “config bundles.”

When in doubt, treat your use as **Substantial Use**.

---

## 6. Derivative Works, Translations, and Reformatting

### 6.1. Derivative Works (Tweaks and Improvements)

You are allowed to **experiment**, **modify**, and **improve** registry keys, configurations, and tweaks **for non-commercial purposes**, and to share those improvements non-commercially, provided that:

1. You give full attribution as in Section 4;
2. You do not sell or gate the derivatives;
3. You do not remove or hide markers, comments, or signatures from the original.

Community experimentation and evolution of tweaks over time is welcome, as long as it remains non-commercial and properly credited.

### 6.2. Translations and Localizations

Translating the Content into another language is considered a **derivative work**.

Any public distribution of translations (e.g., blogs, PDFs, GitHub repos, Discord posts in other servers) must:

- Preserve full attribution (Section 4);
- Clearly state that it is a **translation** of original work by the Owner (and/or Member);
- Not misrepresent the translation as original research.

For **large or standalone translations** (full guide PDF, full website mirror, multi-post series, etc.), **prior written approval from the Owner is required**.

### 6.3. Reformatting and Packaging

You may privately reformat Content (e.g., your own notes, local `.reg` files, local documentation) for personal use.

Any **public** redistribution of substantial or structured copies (e.g., downloadable script collections, preset bundles, server-ready `.reg/.bat` collections, packaged tweak sets) requires:

- Prior written consent from the Owner;  
- Full compliance with attribution and non-commercial rules.

---

## 7. Third-Party Content, Links, and Tools

The Project and the Official Discord **“The PCs Secret”** may include:

- Links to third-party GitHub repositories, tools, scripts, guides, or websites;
- References to content owned and maintained by other authors;
- Embedded snippets that are clearly attributed to another creator or project.

Unless explicitly stated otherwise, such third-party content:

- **Is not owned by the Owner** and is **not** licensed under this Policy;
- Remains subject to its own license and terms set by the original author or project;
- Is only linked or referenced for convenience, testing, or discussion.

This Policy **does not grant you any rights** to use third-party content. You must:

- Check the original license of any external repository, tool, or guide;
- Comply with that third-party license and their usage rules;
- Not assume that a link or mention in **“The PCs Secret”** or this repository means you can reuse or redistribute that third-party content freely.

Any link or reference to third-party content:

- **Does not imply endorsement, partnership, or responsibility** by the Owner;
- Does not transfer any intellectual property rights from the third party to you or to the Owner.

---

## 8. GitHub Forks, Clones, Issues, and Gists

By forking, cloning, or copying this repository (including Issues, Discussions, and Wiki content), **you agree that all such copies remain fully subject to this Policy**.

GitHub’s technical ability to fork, clone, or create gists **does not grant you any rights** beyond those explicitly allowed here. You may not:

- Use forks, mirrors, or gists to circumvent non-commercial restrictions;
- Strip attribution or watermarks in a fork or mirror;
- Re-license the Content under a different license.

---

## 9. Member Content and License to the Owner

### 9.1. Member Ownership

Members retain ownership of their own original content (e.g., discoveries, test results, guides) posted in the Official Discord or contributed to the repository.

### 9.2. Member License to the Owner

By posting Member Content in the Official Discord **“The PCs Secret”** or contributing it to this repository, you grant the Owner a **perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive license** to:

- Use, modify, compile, and integrate the Member Content into the Project;
- Publish and redistribute it as part of the Project or related projects;

You may **not**:

- Remove, alter, obfuscate, or attempt to strip such markers;
